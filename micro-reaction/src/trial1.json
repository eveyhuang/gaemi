How is your story at different than a white man who was once, say, mugged by a black man? Does he now have the liberty to boldly declare that is giving up on black people? I would assume not. So, you are proposing a double standard. You believe that a black man who undergoes a horrible experience due to a white man can hate the white race, but a white man in an analogous situation cannot hate all black people. You don’t end racism through more racism. ",

The lesson I learned growing up poor, was there will always be narrow-minded, bigoted, stupid people of all 'colors' in the world who will use anything or anyone they are afraid of, or can't twist to fit their own narrow views as an excuse to lash out.  However, in my 60 plus years, the ONLY people who have EVER helped me were black people, not white people.  From the big strong \"Trash Man\" who pulled the emergency brake on Mom's car when I knocked it out of gear when I was six, and who will ALWAYS be my hero, to my black co-workers who bought my family a full Thanksgiving dinner out of their own pockets when we were destitute, to the members of the black church who brought bags of groceries to my home after watching me account for every penny as I shopped.  Color shouldn't matter.  Race shouldn't matter.  DNA says we are ALL the same.  But there will always be insecure people out there who say and write mean, hateful things to make themselves feel better.

Whites should not be generalized any more than blacks. The number of comments from whites on this thread in support of your opinion I think demonstrate that not all whites are alike. Second, many whites in this country are also suffering. Joblessness, poverty, lower life expectancy, drug and alcohol abuse, you name it. Does this sound like a system bent in their favor? Third, many whites consider it hypocritical that blacks remain silent over gang violence in, say, Chicago, yet rail about police shootings. Do black lives matter only when whites are involved? Fourth, social change in America is very slow. Yet the well-being of African Americans has been moving in a positive direction, despite the painful experience. Blacks have gone from slaves to citizens to president of the US. I think there is something arrogant about your desire to give up. In comparison to civil rights leaders like MLK, Malcom, or even Abe Lincoln, you haven't suffered enough to earn the right to give up. So don't! As a Jew, blacks can be very racist towards us. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson are examples. Instead of denigrating Jews, blacks should learn from Jewish experience on how a broken people puts itself back together. Lastly, what do blacks want? What does a \"woke\" America actually look like? Blacks have not specified what this vision looks like. ",

The fact that Dr. Yancy is a scholar in race relations, and should have clearly seen how the poor choice of wording could be misconstrued, leads me to believe he is either poor at editing or deliberately chose the title to indicate that he is also a racist. The question comes up then, why would the NY Times give editorial space to a racist? ",

Pathogens from the East killed untold numbers of \"Europeans\" -- this is what killed so many \"Native Americans\" happening in reverse.<br/><br/>IntraAfrican slavery and tribal genocide happened not infrequently and was often large-scale, as you should know. In West African forests, for example, European slavery in fact saved many from certain slaughter as, in David Brion Davis's words, \"heretics deserving death.\" This is not coming from a white supremacist or someone who denies the crimes of European peoples, only from someone who wants others to understand that this is a common way for our species to behave.

M.L.K.Jr. was right on when he spoke of the  three evils which were destroying the U.S. It is true now in 2018 as it was in 1968. First, Militarism - both globally and domestically is alive and well. Just look at what we have done in Iraq,Afghanistan, Syria and our involvement with 800 bases all over the world. We have spent 5.6 TRILLION dollars (Wall Street Journal report) since 2000. Imagine what that could have done to our roads, bridges and schools.<br/>Second, Racism. Are we really blind to the hundreds of young black men shot by our police or the red-lining that still goes on all over the U.S. or the sad state of education and schools for people of color? Thirdly Poverty and materialism and the growing gap where a few Billionaires have more money than all  the people in the bottom half of the country. Capitalism is failing for most USians.<br/>The richest 8 states in 1860  were  Southern states. Why? Their black  slaves made them wealthy. Now look at the way we are treating Latinos fleeing from countries in Central America - countries that we have destroyed  over the past 100 years (read . The Harvest of Empire)<br/>Yes, Mr. Yancey Americans are racist. They will never admit it. Those who live in white zipcodes ( source -- Gallup Poll) voted overwhelmingly for Trump - the commander in chief of racism.",

White people could never tolerate such treatment.  Indeed, our current state is, I think, largely due to the fact that white people are finally realizing that they can no longer make their way in the world with their collective foot on the collective throat of all non-whites.  White people are struggling (and hate is on the rise) because they are slowly, ever so slowly, realizing that they are not as good as they have always been told they are.  So now they turn to opioids, alcohol, more pot — anything to help them deal with the realities that black people have had to deal with for literally centuries: unstable jobs, unpredictable wages, spotty (if any) health care, fairness in the job market, and on and on and on.     The shining city on the hill was such a great idea when someone else built and tended to it.<br/>Professor Yancy, I gave up on white people decades ago.  It’s simply too laborious to try to teach them anything, much less to have them look into a disagreeable mirror and understand what they’ve done to others.  It’s simply beyond their ken.  ",

So, here's a story.  \"Once upon a time\" working in a department that used graduate degrees as self-deceptive fictional shields against the recognition that quality mattered more than compliance, a colleague, a Black man whom I regarded as a friend, joined with me in uselessly confronting authority.  Comrades became supportive friends through personal difficulties.  An  invitation  to dinner with  white people of whom he had spoken positively was accepted but he never showed. Initially he feigned having forgotten but rang off when reminded of logging the date and time. Later, and without being in the least defensive (for that I still love him) spoke of not being comfortable in socializing with white people.  He had begun to advance his career and we became distant. Years later he made a genuinely generous professional offer and,  while appreciatively declining, asked about our friendship. Parting was without any closure though with more sureness on his part.  Now, both retired, I called and asked about meeting. Didn't happen. Anna Freud in addressing the question of dialogue between psychoanalytic and other therapists and spoke of the need not become diverted from our analytic work.  Recalling that talk made his decision understandable, even reasonable and may be useful to your own questioning. Yet what about loss?    ",

As a child, I was the smallest and youngest in my class, and almost pathologically shy.

Do you remember as a child when a grownup was doing something bad; very bad, and you knew it but wasn’t quite sure what it was?  That is what I saw and felt, as our teacher berated this little boy in a tone that felt so ugly and wrong.  I remember his hair was very short, he was an exuberant child, seemingly fearless, and his eyes were tearing and he was fighting the tears.  I remember my fear, something was wrong in her harshness and then I distinctly remember thinking (while shrinking in my seat), I am glad I am not black because the teacher would be yelling at me in that way.  I was no more than six.  I have never forgotten the incident as a child’s view of observed racism in the earliest years.  And the way I rationalized it. I still retain this memory this as a way to understand how the scars run deep and I can’t presume the experience of institutional racism and how it affects black people.  And how insidious it is so that a very shy little girl could recognize from her teacher’s tone and words that  to be black was to be singled out and treated harshly.  I’m not young anymore, or small, or shy for that matter, but it still feels wrong and sad and diminishes all of us.",

Is it a result of a natural phenomenon or due to other causes (including indiscriminate influx of immigrants from all over), I do not know. What I know is, I long for America the way it was when I arrived. Sure it had problems, the largest  of which was dehumanizing segregation against a large section of its own people whose role in the building of America was no less than anyone else's. other's. But it was outright exhilarating to see the movement against segregation growing popular by leaps and bounds. That successive US administrations would dispatch hundreds of National Guards to enforce the rights and entry of a lone black students into schools and colleges would, I believe for ever stand out as a tribute to the collective American peoples' sense for justice and fair play.

While there is much that I admire about Yancy's writings, I'm afraid he badly confuses two very different things: racism and racial bias.<br/><br/>The suffix \"ism\" in \"racism\" connotes an ideology, a systematic set of beliefs - specifically, beliefs that the races are not morally, intellectually, or in some other fundamental fashion equal, but that some races are superior and others are inferior.<br/><br/>A racist consciously holds these beliefs, and accepts them as good, truthful and correct. <br/><br/>Bias is quite different than racism. Bias is not an ideology; bias is a reaction, akin to a reflex, that occurs without conscious thought.<br/><br/>It turns out that relatively few Americans are racists. But all of us, and indeed all humans, are biased. And since the human mind is complex, our biases are complex. We hold biases that contradict our conscious beliefs. We hold biases that we recognize as factually incorrect. We even hold biases against groups to which we belong - as a gay man, I have conducted a life-long battle against such biases.<br/><br/>Accusing all white people of racism is not only factually inaccurate, it is counter-productive, because it fails to distinguish between those for whom race hatred is a desirable state of mind and the rest of us who do not hate, who recognize our biases, and who struggle conscientiously against them.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://politicsbyeccehomo.wordpress.com\" title=\"politicsbyeccehomo.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">politicsbyeccehomo.wordpress.com</a>",

To say all LGBT are the same, whites, blacks, brown, yellow are all the same, men are all the same is a foolish point of view.  From my mountain top you are missing all the beautiful wonderful people that have so much to share with you.  I take everyone one person at a time, some are great some not so much.  I have never seen the limits that the world try's to impose as having much influence over me.  I stand up for what I believe in and have no problem tell someone to their face what I think.  To see now how social media has allowed the cowards of the world to hide and threaten is just sick.  But I will offer this do not give them the stage, they are few and there is this great wonderful country that we live in that has amazing people from all over the world living here (let's not forget about all the great food we have here because of diverse population hummm).  Go out and enjoy all the wonderful color, race, faith, men, women come on we are so very lucky to live here in this time.",

There will be lapses of heart, and of course dignity, but blood does not have to be shed. It is more powerful and more effective to inspire than to convince -- so we shouldn't rashly howl our passions to the ungrateful wind (though it's a sane response to a world that has never made sense). As long as we truly believe in our fellow human beings we won't become assailable or an adversary. ",

To paraphrase Krishnamurti, there is no me separate from society. Society is not distinct from my culture, from my various class divisions, from my religion, from the conflicts and afflictions of the many: all this is society and I am a part of it. <br/><br/>In asking whether or not I should give up on white people, I’ve come to recognize that the question is not only phrased incorrectly, it’s the wrong question entirely. The phrasing issue is that anytime general terms are used to describe or identify a person or people by color, this in itself perpetuates division. The question itself is wrong because it’s not grounded in an understanding of interdependence: that my personal healing and transformation cannot be separated from either your own, nor that of our larger society.<br/><br/>The question I ask instead is this: Since your liberation and mine are incontrovertibly bound together, how do I comfort my own heart in the sea of racial ignorance, ill will, and violence—and do all of my daily actions reflect the world I want to live in and leave to future generations? <br/><br/>I will meet you there.",

The question I ask to Dr. Yancy is: While society isn't set up in favor of blacks, is demanding that whites change it to be such (inevitably falling short) in and of itself racist, as it hurts whites? This is fundamentally a clash between two groups, both with divergent bio-spiritual expressions.",

However, through a progressive family in at the time a white neighborhood, my mother thought that I should have a Boy's Club membership. One night on a summer day camp sleepover I drew the name of a black kid.  I did not know what to do, as internally, my conditioned mind took over.  In the end, I accepted my fate, the two of us in conversation half the night in an Army pup tent. On that one night I learned that there is no difference between black and white people. That night I learned to see through others' eyes. Time went on and I was met with other prejudicial challenges and they were also met head on, on scene, with the help of special people. I have found that prejudice is learned in the medium of ignorance, arrogance and conditioning. It is through the unexpected events in life that one has the opportunity to see the light, grow and meet new people.<br/> No, please don't give up.",

But I must say I reject being lumped in with the rabid haters who wrote such letters to you, just as I reject the idea there is something uniquely or even especially reprehensible about racism in this country. I've been trolled by the same group of people, not because I'm black but because I have the gall to call out the absurd rationales they offer for their despicable ideologies. I have virtually no more in common with this small cadre of raw haters than you do. And as someone who travels extensively in Europe and Asia, I can assure you the incidence of deep, ugly racism in those societies is no less prevalent than it is here, and in many cases it is probably more prevalent. Your analysis, therefore, suffers from structural flaws. You need to draw the valid distinction between those who hate anything and everything that threatens their pathetic sense of entitlement, including both you and me, and those like me who struggle with the lingering injustices of the legacy of white male privilege. People like me don't hate others because of the color of their skin or their religious beliefs. While that doesn't relieve us of our obligations, it does challenge you to reach out to us in less polarizing ways.",

I still think America is the best place for me and my family. With all the nasty things going on, I still believe working within the system is my best option. Of course racism is real. White people is the majority and they founded and built America. It is merely human nature to protect tribal interests. In fact, white people are the most generous people in human history! The demographic change in this country is happening peacefully. It is also very true that \"underrepresented minorities\" working with the system can have a lot more opportunities (than Asian Americans). It is a well-known fact that certain minority groups can get in elite schools easier (than Asian Americans).<br/>What are the options left? (1) Work within the system is the surest thing to become successful. (2) As I have suggested, black people may want to follow the footstep of Mormons and move to a state to become the supermajority. I think Detroit/Michigan is a good place. The city needs more people. Instead of bringing in more immigrants (totally beyond me), Detroit should invite the relocation of black people to build the promised land with the full control of destiny. (3) Actions are needed. stop the wishful thinking of changing human nature. There is no hope because it is in the DNA. ",

I'm Jewish, I am a senior, I've been divorced and remarried, an army veteran (1966), a college kid, a father and grandfather. I've been around the block and I'm very well worn.  I've also felt the pain of discrimination and rejection. But I don't hate anyone or feel anger and resentment. I'm just tired and saddened.  We've been denied homes, bank loans, jobs, places in class, promotions, and a host of other things. I understand the vicious hatred of too many whites and blacks. I get it. Here's what I don't get; In 1981 my 5 year old went off to kindergarten. He was truly excited and anxious to ride the bus with all the other kids and enjoy this new adventure.  He came home and told us of his new experience. All went well then he said \"You know dad, black girls are meaner than white girls.\" He told me how they acted and what they did and said. I was very disappointed. I still am. I know blacks have been abused, targeted and discriminated against. But why the continuous stream of bad social behavior and criminal activity from a people who want to be integrated and enjoy the social benefits of belonging to our communities? Mr. Yancy, end that behavior and the anger directed towards everyone including yourselves. Join us in educating children and teaching better ways of living together and not acting out. We can stop the bigotry by not giving racists excuses for their hatred. Excellence and achievement. Not criminality.",

It happened again to me on Monday: a man in my neighborhood who has attempted to assault me in the past screamed at me because a tow truck touched his driveway.  (It was towing my truck.)  The week before, a woman had told me a story of rape in her childhood that sickened me.  I went to a group of trusted women to talk about giving up on men.  I said that some days I just wished they would all go away.  Instead of support, I got a backlash of blame, and I was urged to be \"more compassionate.\"<br/><br/>I can't know what it's like to be a black person in America. I am guessing that if I took my experience as a white woman and amplified it to the second or third power, I might have an inkling of what black people go through on a daily basis.  <br/><br/>We who are oppressed are urged to be compassionate always, to love our enemies, etc.  Maybe in the best of all possible worlds we could do that.  But most days we are just very, very tired.  <br/><br/>I am also told (especially by other women) that there are also good men in the world.  Yet when I try to talk to \"good men\" about my experiences of patriarchy, they become very defensive or angry.  Sometimes they sympathize briefly, but then confess to violent impulses and fantasies of their own.  I am very close to giving up on them.

Our limited time, mental energy, and passion must not be wasted on futile efforts that only drain them.<br/><br/>Racism today exists not because racist people are more uninformed or uneducated than the rest (my personal experience tells otherwise). Modern institutional racism was not born out of some inborn ignorance of 16th century europeans towards dark skinned people, but from political and economic reasons that necessitated the former. (Remember that they had black popes and generals in ancient Rome. History or morality is not a linear function.)<br/>As such, nothing less than economic and political power of black folks will eliminate it.",

This was when I came of age and went off to college where I developed many friendships with African Americans. This was in Kansas and honestly the single person who uttered anything remotely racist in my presence had an eastern accent. <br/><br/>During the 80s it seems things began to change drastically. Though I continued to maintain friendships with a large number of African Americans, I could tell that the culture was drifting backwards. By the time the cocaine gang wars had run their course followed by the LA riot and the OJ Simpson verdict, I think a lot of white people had given up on black people. <br/><br/>So if black people want to give up on white people-- in stark, general terms, which to me is foolish-- then I guess both sides will have given up on each other and we don't have much room left for any kind of positive future ahead of us. <br/><br/>It makes no more sense for a white person who has been mugged by a black person or who had bad experiences with a couple of black guys during busing to blame all black people, nor does it for a professor to blame 200 million white people for thousands of pieces of hate mail.

Many of them, now on death row, are in despair of their own behavior. Even Judas hanged himself.<br/><br/>Cf. Sam Harris' \"Free Will,\" and you will understand why, theologically speaking, Satan often seems to rule the world. Or \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\" where we learn that even the best of us contain monsters inside covered up with a thin veneer of civilization, which we desperately need. Or Sigmund Freud's mostly rejected works, which posit the id, a boiling cauldron of desire, anger, and violence, which the superego tries to control. B.F. Skinner's behaviorism also supports the contention that we are but meat puppets.<br/><br/>We are irrational.",

I was bullied badly as a child and young person and the best lesson I learned is to never let the bullies win. I was bullied by Black schoolmates and White schoolmates. This showed me that \"Race\" is not really relevant to individual nastiness. You should turn over to the Police any threats that can be backtracked to their sender. Threats are not free speech.     <br/><br/>In general I'm ambivalent as to if your field of study is valid. Anthropology and Genetics have shown that \"Race\" isn't real - it's an ever shifting shadow. It is a shadow that we deal with all the time - a convenient lie we are better off without. I tried to swap in \"Ethinic\" instead of race in day to day speech. It made things like \"People of Color\" very hard to use - so it went away too.    <br/><br/>Still - I'm married into a Chinese family and am subject to pervasive anti-white \"Racism\" - and since I'm a stay at home dad - pervasive \"Sexism\". I've done nothing except parent for a quarter century - but my female relatives wouldn't think of taking my advise. I'm male - I can't know anything. White people are silly and wasteful and have a streak of violence. So I really can't be trusted. It is frustrating to be treated as not quite smart enough to come in out of the rain - and not completely safe to be around. <br/><br/>The mistake of Race is pervasive.        ",

A solid majority of white Americans has voted Republican ever since 1968; the only times the majority was not overwhelmingly Republican was when Ross Perot ran in 2002 and 2006, siphoning votes away from the GOP candidates. Yes, I am equating Republicans with racism; Trump's selection as the party's candidate basically ends any discussion of the issue. The fact that American voting habits break down so solidly along racial lines underlines the reality to which Dr. Yancy speaks. Racism runs through the core of American politics. It is the birthright of white Americans. It is something that can only be fought if white Americans recognize it and accept that this is true. Race lies at the heart of almost every major social and political division in the US (even abortion, which began as a way to rally Christian evangelicals who were opposed to desegregating their universities and schools). It is time for white Americans to accept this innate social sickness and commit to opposing it.  ",

I think, and I've told white people, that your people are a higher group than the white.  I show specific respect to any African-American whom I encounter.  The response is almost always a relaxing movement, a smile that reaches the eyes that telegraphs thanks.  Whites who want to show respect to black folks should be encouraged to do so. I am very grateful to you for your restraint and striving to be heard and understood.  I'm determined that someday it will be 'our people' instead of 'yours' and 'mine'.  By the way, I grew up on the South side of Chicago.  I know that African-Americans are as good, probably better, than most white people.  And way better than the ones who've insulted and demeaned you.",

To condemn a whole group based on the actions of a few would be racist, which is what I am not.  Sorry, Yancy, I think that you're taking on the moral values of the racists themselves which won't help anyone.  Will we ever be able to cure racism in the hearts of every individual?  Of  course not. But is systemic and structural racism over in America?  Yes, it is.  Just look at the proof--a black man was elected president twice in row.

As I said this, Peter cozied up to her and tried to lean on her as he does with people he likes. I was feeling good. She was smiling and laughing.

However, its not only white people that are racists and somehow, other races aren't. We have seen black Africans discriminate against fellow Africans and we have also seen the non-stop killing that happens there. I venture to say that the racism that white people display is no worse than blacks would have shown, if the tables were turned. If black civilization had attained the heights of the European one, and whites were at the level that Africans are, it would be impossible not to have the same effect. And it is true, that European civilization is what has advanced all of humanity. No one claims that whites were saints. Yes, they did mistreat American indians and almost extinguished them from this land. But, let's not forget that eventually, they saw the error of their ways and have strived to do better, without being forced to. The British were the original slavers, but, they were the ones who outlawed slavery and enforced it with their navy. While slavery is still practiced in many African countries. Let's not forget that white advancement in medicine and hygiene, which has benefited every nation and peoples on earth, has more than made up white savagery of years past. That goes for African Americans. ",

The preacher was talking about Black Lives Matter and the need for white people to examine our attitudes toward race in America. Some of the adults were extremely angry about the sermon and were so furious it was hard to process the service with the teenagers in a rational way. However, in subsequent meetings and discussions with the teenagers (without those adults present), we were able to talk about the perspective of the speaker. I found the teenagers to be very open to the speakers' perspective and embarrassed by the response of the adults (who were parents). They did not feel any need whatsoever to defend the perspectives of their parents and thought they were clearly wrong. Confederate flags and monuments are a big issue in our city and these same white teenagers are disgusted with both and wish we could get rid of them. I feel very hopeful for the future. And perhaps these young people will be able to reason with their parents and help them see another perspective, but if not, they will certainly have different attitudes going forward. It can't come soon enough.  ",

And we need to work with you, both now and continuously. Years ago, when I met a white minister who had been active in the civil rights movement in the '60s (also named King), I thanked him for coming to speak at my university and told him how important I thought his actions had been. And his response was \"well, the work continues...\" And I realized for the first time that day that civil rights is an on-going movement, and process. *Everyone* who cares about freedom has to keep it going--but they need people like you as a guide.",

I taught in a city school for many years being hyper vigilant about how I treated my highly integrated classes of students.  I taught alongside black teachers and administrators some good some bad like all the rest of us. When behavioral issues cropped up, it was disproportionately from impoverished black kids, yet I tried to be understanding and many times gave black kids an extra chance or an extra hug as needed.  Some might say I went easier on them. One day, driving to school, a black  teen  from the neighborhood threw a rock at my car near my head. I had a huge dent on the driver's side and for a long time I was afraid of driving down the street I had to drive by to get to my school.  I was indignant; hurt that someone would try to hurt me for no reason. I realize that's exactly how black folks must feel much of the time. Still, I never gave up on my black high school students.  In fact, I was adamant that they succeed, sometimes seeming to care for their success more than they did. In my local and state elections I make sure that I vote for minorities and women if they are capable. Lastly, I don't use hateful language towards any group of people and neither do my friends or family members.  If  needed, I will stand up for your just and equal treatment, Mr. Yancy.

While it is not comparable to white racism in its effect, this reactionary bigotry should show us how difficult it is for people to let go of the deeply entrenched tendency to make crude generalizations about others. The Times is continually publishing articles and op-eds where the author casually and with no sense of irony talks about what is wrong with “men” or “whites”. Bigotry is bigotry. Some people get so caught up in their understandable emotional reaction to injustice that they fall right into this trap. When called on it, outrage ensues. The fact is, you cannot and should not assign negative attributes to people based on characteristics like this. “Men” do not oppress women and “whites” no longer oppress blacks (government sanctioned systemic racism is dead). Plenty of people who happen to be women or happen to be black inflict injustice on others, and obviously plenty of people who are white are racist jerks. Their gender and pigmentation are not the cause of their shortcomings. NYT, you can do better.",

On the other hand, you give hundreds of thousands of white people a perspective that helps us wrestle with inherited (not inherent) racism. That's very useful for everyone, especially the young.

If you were to find the sources of those threats and insults they would probably be traced to a relatively few people.  I'm only speculating but it appears that the author has been targeted, and it's working.  That's what they do and how they do it.<br/>It's an old formula.<br/>The white minister of the church I attended as a teen was targeted by the local KKK because of his stance and activity in the Civil Rights movement.  They bombed his house and the church. They would call him up on a regular basis at 2:00 am saying he, and his family, had ten minutes before the bomb went off.  The police eventually caught the guys who set the dynamite.  They were given five year jail terms (ha!), it was in the 1960's. They worked for a local sign company in the town where I live now.  I wish I knew that when we moved here in 1975, but it's just as well we didn't.<br/>Learn to fight back.  They are cowards.  If I suggested the obvious the NYT would censor the comment.",

Not all white people are like these, and even though their numbers are still large, they are slowly decreasing over time as a percentage of the population.  These people you cannot change with arguments or logic.  Every once in a while you read about some racist that has an epiphany and sees the error of his ways.  These are exceedingly few, but it shows what really has to happen.  This type of change has to come from within.  You should not give up on white people.  You should, however, give up on racists.",

(1) Get blacks in charge of these schools and change them to focus on benefitting students, not the teachers' unions. (2) Get blacks to start and run small businesses in the black community.  Why is it that most stores in black communities are run by immigrants?  (3) Police your own communities.  Don't rely upon white cops to keep crime down.  Form block watches, citizen patrols, etc.  There are plenty more ideas but this would be a good start.",

You said your letter was a \"gift,\" and should be received with \"love.\"  It was entirely to be expected that you would receive many angry replies and that some would be intemperate.  I can't speak for everyone but a lot of us were brought up to believe that racism is a moral failing  and a matter of choice (and not something that is simply an inescapable part of being born).<br/><br/>You're a smart guy so I'm sure you get that when you accuse a couple hundred million people that you don't know, and have never met, of all being immoral racist bigots, then a lot of them are not going to like you. And surely you also get that telling people what a “gift” it is be so accused by you is really not calculated to improve matters. <br/><br/>I am not defending the haters and I can’t tell you whether you should give up on white people, but if you’re serious about getting your message across, maybe next time consider a different approach.",

The United States is one of the least racist countries in the world (and that includes Africa, with its intense tribal conflicts). Progress has been made but there is much to do.

This previously coddled class of Americans has been detrimentally impacted by free trade, immigration, the digital revolution and soon will be additionally impacted by the artificial intelligence revolution.  How will these people react?  My guess is with increasing hatred and desperation.  If I remember correctly the industrial revolution caused a similar upheaval in the working classes and resulted in the growth of fascism, communism and other forms of totalitarian regimes and eventually led to both class conflict and armed conflict among nations.  Let's hope that the sane more educated voices in society will prevail in the future, but I am not terribly hopeful for the short term outlook of America. ",

The case just so happens to be that in America we sit at a place where some people own and run the country and some take orders and try to get along as best as possible. The maxim in play is ancient: as attributed to Thucidides in 400 BC, \"The strong do as they wish, the weak do as they must.\" Skin color is not a factor. If you were to investigate social structures where Black men dominate, you will see the same behavior as where another race is in charge, be it White or Chinese.<br/><br/>The job of a teacher is to elucidate truths, not make believe they are agents of change.

So I must ask myself, is it not my responsibility and the responsibility of other white people to educate and eradicate white racists?  To stand up in the face of hate as was done in Charlottesville?  The answer to that is yes.  White folks must stand up to white racism and hatred.  I must stand up to it.  I have not really done that.  Oh, I have posted on Facebook or twitter.  I have written a couple of letters and called my representatives.  But standing up to hatred is more than that.  It scares me because I dislike confrontation.  But then I think of you Mr. Yancy.  I think of your courage in the face of hatred.

But I think the better nature of humanity will win out, that this is just a very nasty potholed section of road we're crossing to get to the future.  Every few decades, looking back, things were far worse than they are now.<br/><br/>So again, I'd exhort you and others not to give up on white people.

The idea of “giving up” on a race is fraught with assumptions, stereotypes, and racism.   While your writings suggest that change is impossible for you, indeed a lot of America has moved on.  Young people (mostly) don’t see race, many have interracial friends and relationships, and are drawn to a common American culture.   Decrying “white privilege” is a false charge for the problems that face blacks.   90%of America lives hand to mouth and struggle to afford education, health care, and just get by.  This is not a race issue but an American issue.",

Many blacks are racist too and discriminatory. Black men discriminate against females. That your accusations against whites is discriminatory too. Most whites I know do not tolerate racism. Why would Obama win twice for the presidency if Americans, who are mostly white, were racist? The Republicans won the election because whites are exhausted of accusations of racism. Race politics is totally out of control these days. Blacks suffer from crime from other blacks much more than from whites. In education, it is mostly black kids who misbehave and do not do their work disrupting classes and expecting good grades without doing the necessary work. Then they call their teachers and professors racist if they are expected to follow the rules and do their work. Employers are afraid to hire blacks because they are called racist if criticized for their performance. Moreover, students need their professors and teachers, of any race or gender, for protection and support. When professors and teachers behave in an emotional weak manner, students feel uncomfortable and disappointed when they don't have a role model to look up to. Therefore, focus on excellence instead of persecution. This does not mean there aren't racist hateful people out there. But these individuals are unethical, negative, and hateful in all areas of their lives, not just racism.",

She was a woman with an intense awareness of the world and a superb judge of the human condition.

And, guess what. When I did the genetic tests for inherited diseases, I got none of the inherited disease genes, plus the gene that gives your children traits of a Olympic athlete. My father referred to it as hybrid vigor. <br/><br/>So, my mother’s wisdom was right on the money. She fixed the race of her children and we became white in the eyes of others. And, all her descendants are healthy and strong. <br/><br/>Go ahead, marry someone who looks exotic. Your children will thank you for it. ",

The attitudes and beliefs that permitted and encouraged such awful things do not change that swiftly or miraculously disappear. My point is that White supremacist hatred and value systems are in the DNA of America and are passed along in subtle and in the most virulent forms from generation to generation. Recent examples include the racist murder of nine Black worshippers in their church and the White Supremacists marching in Charlottesville. Experience shows us that over time, (a long time ) the virulence of this disease will lose some of its potency. There are many hopeful signs especially among the young and yet much work to do. The memory of the past and the origins of White racism are often erased in history lessons, replaced with more palatable stories and romanticized versions of the American story. America cannot fix what it will not face.",

Likewise, is American history, a glorious example of high aspirations based on a fundamental belief in the just capacities of humanity, to be judged by the worst of our ancestors and then only viewed from the perspective of our present day, self asserted morality?<br/><br/>There are multiple story lines in the lives of most people; you could oversimplify it and reduce it to the good, the bad and the ugly, and there are multiple story lines of America. Are we to be judged by the actions of the southern states 150+ years ago, subjecting 600,000 citizens to death to protect slavery, or by the thousands of white people who fought and died to preserve the Union and bring an end to this horrid chapter in our history?<br/><br/>White people have risked their lives to fight racism and to try for a better, more just and enlightened society. I would have done likewise, except that I was not old enough during the most active civil rights struggles to take part at that level. Yet, from about the age of 14 onward, social fairness and the eradication of racial injustice has been a central cause of my life. It is true everyday still.<br/><br/>Let the evil haters who tried to enter your life go. It is not white people who oppress, but SOME white people who wish to continue.

We should see racial attributes like eye color, accidents of nature that just don't represent more than what it apparent. <br/><br/>White supremacy is nothing more than people trying to deal with bad conscience, to blame they way they are mistreating others to exploit them on nature or God. <br/><br/>Ignorance does not go away until the mind becomes aware of things about which it was unaware. Racism reflects ignorant minds. This is no excuse for the harm done. Most of the harm done by people is due to ignorance or indifference but we tend only to hold people accountable for malicious intentionality. <br/><br/>As a society we never made the effort to confront racism and to eliminate the false concepts upon which it depends. Even affirmative action was never undertaken as a sincere effort to help minorities overcome the lost opportunities of centuries of discriminations, but a penance to be performed like a ritual but without any real personal commitments.<br/><br/>Today, the legacies of racism are far from over. Racists conscious and unconscious are still too great a proportion of our people to be considered a minor cause of distress for others but they no longer dominate the majority.",

I didn't know why they hated a woman they didn't know. A woman I loved deeply.  I think it was my first jog from childhood innocence that something wasn't right in this world.

Being slave owners messed up white people -- and I don't mean that they deserve pity. I mean that white people, especially in the South, had to become hardened to witnessing suffering; they had to learn to dehumanize three quarters of the people living around them; they had to be perpetually afraid because the people living around them generally hated them. It is that fear, deeply embedded, that lingers the most. The rest of it, the layers of dismissal of black people, come from that terror. If those racists truly believed blacks were inferior, they wouldn't need to terrorize them.<br/>It isn't all white people who have that level of hatred, though. I think what most middle class white people have is a much lazier understanding of the world. (e.g. \"If you don't want babies at 15, don't have them\" etc) A kind of simplified \"just world\" view where poor people probably did something wrong and just need to start doing things right, that's all. This is why white people can like their black neighbors but think the people living in the black neighborhood down the street probably caused their own problems.<br/>To fix all that is tricky.

One possibility for attacking us is they have a sadistic streak and are attempting to appease some insatiable and perverted need to experience their dominion over another and create suffering.<br/>Because some people are like that, and others are dependent on those people, and still others expect people to be mean so they are too.<br/>Some are just depressed.<br/>And so what do we do? Well, we advocate, because that is what is needed. That is what works. Elie Wiesel said it best, the opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. So you and I do what we do, because it matters. This is how we matter. We take a stand.<br/>How many of us will take a stand? It completely depends on how many of us will take a stand.<br/>Build your resilience people, and take a stand.",

I believe an honest person admits to no certain answer, except to feel it personally as a failure of humanity and compassion. <br/><br/>The fact that individuals can learn to overcome racism does not weigh against its global expression and species persistence.

Long term the problem will solve itself.  We have approximately 200 million whites and 40 million blacks.  25% of black men marry whites and have phenotypically black children.  We can expect that in three generations of 25 years that the white and black population will be roughly equal and and both will be minorities.  That is assuming the intermarriage rate stays the same but we probably will see more black females marrying whites over time as well so equilibration may be sooner than we think.

We're seeing right now what happens when you give credence to ignorant and racist beliefs simply by repeating them publicly. It begets more racist speech. Instead, let's facilitate their fade into obscurity by refusing to share the microphone. Instead, engage in the dialogue with those \"whites\", to generalize, that are open to the discussion and WANT to improve the situation and dialogue. And there is no quicker way to shut down that conversation than to assume that the white person is guilty until proven innocent. The heart of the argument against racism is that you shouldn't stereotype an entire race because of a few examples. But this has to go both ways. ",

I am persecuted by it. I am impoverished by it.  It is my struggle, and losing that struggle would turn me into the monster Dr Yancy describes and who he would also become if he gave up on people who happen to be white.  It is human instinct that lives in us all to find refuge in tribalism  and similarity.  Banishment and isolation are deadly to the great apes, and those who find sanctuary in sameness can become dangerous and deadly because of their fear.

We are a diverse religious community in which inter-racial and multicultural marriage is supported.<br/><br/>As part of my personal journey as a white woman in this society, I have faced my own privilege and biases over the years. To be<br/>honest with oneself requires pain as well as careful study of what the Black experience is and has been. I find, though, that frying to talk to other white people about how terrorized Black people are by the police, (for example) I don't get very far. But I can speak of these of these things with other members of the Baha'i Faith because they know, from long familiarity with people different from them, that this is not a fair country.",

I have been rattled by what the \" black lives matter \" has shown us. I had thought we were passed that and the next challenges were to figure out how to overcome the unfair legacies of segregation ranging from red lining to de facto school segregation and the puzzling difficulties of implicit bias. But unconscious bias is not the same as explicit racism. <br/><br/>But let us not forget our previous president, Obama, a great man of integrity was elected as a black man( although he is both). The majority of Americans did not vote for the Trump racism. We should celebrate the progress made, and now we should be fully awake to how short that progress is, and commit to continuing forward.

There are many white people who at least recognize it, but not nearly enough, as evidenced by the fact that 58% of white voters went for Trump. That fact alone justifies giving up on us, if not for ethics and morals, then for straight up stupidity that should not be allowed to pollute the gene pool.<br/><br/>Sorry, I don't have much of a rationale for continuing to engage us, other than the fact that the younger generation is getting more diverse and more aware of racial issues. My 17- and 14-year-old kids can discuss race in a more sophisticated and nuanced way than my 77-year-old mother. When I recently pointed out to my mother that something she said was subtly biased and racist, she said it couldn't be because she had volunteered for our town's fair housing council 50 years ago. As if racism is binary, a 1 or a 0.<br/><br/>I think we are having that \"national conversation about race\" that racists cited as a way to shut down debate. It's a hard conversation, and it's a lot harder for the black and brown people that it is for us white people. But we need to own the conversation too, and own our complicity in the system.",

What astounds me that many are not. I ran into a woman whose racism I had always expected, but since it hadn't been spoken out loud, she continued to be a friend. Finally, in a group, she declared it in no uncertain terms. At that moment, I was so stunned that I couldn't think of anything to say, but later in an email I told her as kindly as I could what I felt. My opinion was not received with any understanding, but with great vitriol. It may be hopeless to expect any white person with such prejudices to listen to those of us who speak up.

If it is, the response is to educate themselves further about the issues, and address racist comments or behavior when they see them firsthand.<br/><br/>There's a collective yearning for a more direct, focused place to put time and energy once those steps have been taken, but there doesn't seem to be one. There are massive stores of untapped energy and passion here, and somebody should harness it for collective action towards specific goals. <br/><br/>While it's understandable to place the responsibility on white people themselves to find solutions, we've generally listened closely enough to understand the absurdity of organizing fellow white people and attempting to educate them ourselves. Surely without black leadership, that would simply center white voices and be a self-congratulatory waste of time? Similarly, the more one listens, the less clear it is whether the presence of white people at events related to visible organizations like BLM would be welcome, or whether it would be presumptuous and intrusive.<br/><br/>Don't give up on white people. Just tell us what to do, how to help, and what goal we're specifically working towards right now. Because I personally have spoken to dozens who would exhaust their resources to help the cause.",

I have been aware of my innate racism since I was very young, thanks to the Civil Rights movement and living in integrated NYC neighborhoods. I am always ashamed when racist attitudes and suppositions pierce my complacency, and force me to own them. The 2016 election and the groups that have been emboldened by this presidency have removed any foolish notions I had, along the lines of \"most white people don't think that way.\"<br/>Like you, I have wondered if white people can ever be redeemed, when our society continues to reflect the imbalances wrought by enslaving people so long ago. It may sound fatuous, but I thought the Civil Rights movement, and the involvement of so many whites in it, was an attempt to address those wrongs. Now I understand that most blacks find the Civil Rights movement to be a failure, while whites believe the opposite. So, we still have a big problem.<br/>Two final points. I believe there is a lot more wrong with your meat-hook letter writers than their whiteness or ethnic roots. I don't think you should give up on white people because of them. And, maybe I will never know what it's like to be black in America, but women who write forthrightly are subjected to the same filth all the time, and we don’t (okay! generally don’t!) give up on all men because of it.",

It provides the clear scientific back-up (facts) for its conclusions, unlike Professor Yancy's generalizations. Yancy may suppose that Americans are familiar with the many studies showing the often unconscious bias leading to discrimination which are systemic and structural in our society. Many are not aware of them.  Many who are still try to wiggle and wriggle out of the obvious conclusion: systemic and structural racism is still a part of our culture. Reading the comments on the article about the crisis of black mothers reveals the extent to which many will go to remain blind to the conclusion and it's factual basis. It's very revealing.<br/><br/>I have only one suggestion for Professor Yancy. I wish he and the NYT would publish in book form both his original essay and all of the letters he received in answer to it (good and bad). The NYT could print the comments sections to these opinion pieces in a separate section, and perhaps include those which were deemed unfit to print. <br/><br/>I think we should all ask ourselves honestly whether we remember, even years afterward, vicious or even just nasty and unfair words spoken and acts done to us.

I have experienced many of the same things that Dr. Yancey has. I've received the slurs, the threats. The hatred by whites is palpable. This is not \"imagined\" victimhood. <br/><br/>And so we have to ask ourselves that when the facts suggest more than half of white Americans believe as Trump does, why shouldn't Dr. Yancey, and others, like myself, give up on them?

But don’t think for a minute that the enmity ends when you look just like everyone else.  <br/><br/>In Europe the economic obstacles kept Jews down as a community for centuries.  That is essentially what Blacks in the US have now:  spoken and unspoken economic bias that denies (or depresses) opportunity to education, access to borrowing (because it too is based on money) and therefore at its base the law continues to prevent self-investment, communal investment and a real economic future to large numbers of darker skinned Americans.  <br/><br/>The only “solution” if there is one is to continue to push for real opportunity and recognition, to work towards communal investment from all sources including the monies of the small percentage of extremely successful members of the black community.  Blacks are no different than other “minorities.” They just stand out because of skin color and that allows bigots to hide behind their own.  The US recognizes only the green color of money when it comes to “value.”  Darker skinned minorities don’t have leisure to “give up” on whites, but that doesn’t mean they can or ought to forgive those who cannot let go of ignorant hate and actions based on it.",

According to the Census Bureau, the United States is percent 76.9 percent white, up from 72.4 percent in 2010.  The Census Bureau’s most recent projection, released in March 2018, is that America will be 68 percent white in 2060.  However, in “Who Is White?: Latinos, Asians, and the New Black/Nonblack Divide,” George Yancey expresses his fear that non-black minorities—Asians and Hispanics—will adopt the perspectives of the white majority group and become assimilated and acculturated.  He’s probably correct. The Census Bureau counts most Hispanics as whites, and on our most populous states—California and Texas—intermarriage between “Anglos” and Hispanic whites is becoming as much the rule as it is the exception. Intermarriage between whites and Asians is increasingly common. Yancey is right to worry. Since a large part of what is perceived as racial prejudice is actually class prejudice, reducing the racial income gap is the surest way to reduce prejudice against African Americans.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/demo/P25_1144.pdf\" title=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/demo/P25_1144.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/demo...</a><br/><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217\" title=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217</a>",

Let us suppose that 99 percent of whites in America were not in the slightest bit racist, using any definition you like (which would be a great achievement -- probably every large group of people in the world have more than 1 percent racists). There are around 170 million white people in the United States, so that would still mean there would be 1.7 million white racists, larger than most cities. If only 1 percent of those sent you a racist letter, that would be 17,000 racist letters. I'm sure you got far less than that -- probably not even 1700.<br/><br/>So your receipt of racist letters, tweets or other correspondence shows nothing other than what anyone should know -- out of 170 million people, there are going to be some bad ones. It is of course upsetting to receive the letters that you discuss, but it is no reflection on the greater population of white people, just like bad acts by a few black people does not reflect on the greater population of black people.<br/><br/>Also, I should point out that you actually don't know the race of anyone who sent you an anonymous piece of correspondence.

One consolation for the non-white religious is that some years ago a number of ossuaries (boxes in which human bones are placed for entombing after the flesh has left them) were discovered in a cave/tomb that was discovered in Jerusalem after almost 2,000 years. Solid evidence suggests that they were the burial ossuaries of the family of Jesus of Nazareth, and included one that appeared to be that of Jesus himself. Needless to say, Israel guards these artifacts carefully, as it would call into question the whole tenet of Christian faith that Jesus rose on the third day and ascended to heaven – a global crisis of immense proportions could result if all this were publicly examined.<br/><br/>However, in the ossuary that could have been that of Jesus, DNA was extracted from the remains, and it was determined that the person in life had kinky, African hair. So, Mr. Yancy should respond to his detractors (and assailants) by posting on white supremacist websites that the likelihood is moderate-to-high that their messiah was a man with at least a high proportion of black blood; and that rather than attacking him (Yancy), they should be venerating him.<br/><br/>My advice to Mr. Yancy: keep up the good work, don’t give up on white people, and when given the choice between crying and laughing, choose to laugh.",

Because we know our strength from our history.<br/>There are whites who even now want to go back to their heritage of supremacy. Even now they try to erase Obama's existence and the rich history of our achievements.<br/>The hate ship has sailed. It's passengers don't know it and will drown in its bowels as did many of our slave ancestors in the slave ship middle passage. Let them hate. We are winning. They can't stop it. Hate has never been our ally. Let it be their's.<br/>The non-white population of the world dwarfs the white population. It continues to grow despite war and colonialism. That tide cannot be turned. Those who look backwards are doomed. Those who look forward will write the future. Those who embrace it prosper.",

If they thought YOU could identify them, or could subject THEM to the same threats they levy at you, they'd cower back under their rocks. We've seen this again and again, since the KKK didn't attack MLK at night, knowing he was guarded by armed men, yet they murdered Schwerner, Cheney, and Goodman knowing they were NOT guarded.<br/><br/>Perhaps the left-wing \"ban all guns\" movement has it all wrong, and the Left and People of Color should be armed.  It's a terrible thing to say, a terrible thing to think, but probably EVERY racist attacking has a firearm of some sort.  It just goes together.<br/><br/>We saw, in Charlottesville, that when armed racists were confronted with equally armed and determined antis, they ran, they backed down, they cowered, or they pulled out their guns.  They want us afraid, but they need to be the ones afraid.  That's the lesson we keep refusing to learn.",

The horrible, cowardly trolls who write these wretched things to you are not representative of all white people any more than all the thousands of misogynists filling comments sections with threats to kill and rape women writers are representative of all men.  There are terrible racist troglodytes out there, but they make up a minority of white people—an ugly, loud, scary minority, but a minority nonetheless. They are beyond the reach of rationality. But there are way too many white people who, while not holding such disturbing views, fail to confront them in others, and we all know that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing. Equality requires that decent white people live their convictions by confronting racist views and speech when they hear them, by being honest with themselves about their own implicit biases, and by taking affirmative steps to address discrimination.  I sometimes feel overwhelmed with rage and sadness about the persistence of sexism. That feeling gives me some small sense of how Dr. Yancy and other black Americans must feel about the racism that still  imbues not just random individuals but also key social institutions.  It must be enraging, frightening, disheartening, and ultimately exhausting. Please know how much your writing in The Stone inspired me to try to better live my convictions.

I can't do anything about those people's hatred. I can only do my best to check my own internal racism and to treat other people--whatever their skin tone--as equal human beings, to judge them not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character, precisely as Dr. King dreamed. <br/><br/>I was a 10-year-old kid in that housing project when Dr. King was assassinated, too young to understand what he stood for and too used to the integrated neighborhood where we lived to know about poisonous white racism such as Dr. Yancy describes. It breaks my heart to read his words, to know of his and others' suffering because of racism. <br/><br/>All I can say, really, is I will continue to be a white gay man (I can't change those characteristics about myself) who does all I can to make others feel welcome and respected.",

Yet, this opinion piece has much of that insane logic: white people are all racist because some white people are racist.

The more serious problem is how we act and how our actions affect those oppressed.<br/><br/>We can't effectively train the racial bias out of police. All we can do is train them not to shoot innocent people.

I aspire every day to try my best to 'untie my ropes', to become un-blind to my own racist complicity.<br/><br/>The history of racism and white supremacy/ privilege in America is long and complex - and too often horrifying and angering as well. But perhaps most importantly, *it is unknown to the vast majority of Americans*.<br/><br/>But there is one concept about it which is fairly easy to understand: black Americans didn't create white supremacy and institutional racism, white Americans did. Black Americans don't perpetuate white supremacy and institutional racism, white Americans do. What does this mean? Quite simply it means that white Americans have to be the ones to totally dismantle that system of their own making.<br/><br/>In the 140 years since the end of slavery and reconstruction, black Americans have fought tooth and nail to dismantle these systems. There has definitely been progress, but this progress has basically been only so much as white America has chosen to concede.<br/><br/>I say to any white American willing to listen: Learn. Listen.

Most devastating is that it is not limited to whites, or males, or Southerners, but all of us, even the oppressed, have eaten from the stew of cultural stereotypes and been poisoned by it. I have watched race relations morph and twist since the 1950's. I have observed changes in attitudes towards Blacks in myself and those around me. I have been heartened by the progress of the movement. But it has shifted in a fundamental way. It no longer relies essentially on laws against race, though they are still important. It does not rely on Black officials, soldiers, doctors, lawyers. actors and police officers as they are mainstream. It does not rely on education, marches, etc. to survive.<br/>    I live in Oklahoma in a suburban upper middle class neighborhood populated by professionals. It is not gated, but it easily could have been. Were I so crass as to want to make a racist slur to a coworker, I would have to make sure that a Black coworker was not standing behind me. If I wanted to say something to my next door neighbor, I must hold my tongue because his black son-in-law is a college administrator, not to speak of his grandson. Were I to make a remark to my brother-in-law, who was a casual racist a few decades ago, well his daughter dated a black man for years and somehow that doesn't come out anymore. This is the real integration and finally it seems to be doing its job. ",

Then it would be in the work place. After that it’s anybody’s guess. I know that when I came of age in the seventies, black people did not want to hang with me, and I had no clue as to what a black person was even about much less to be hanging out with. I looked at a young black man who was my age and thought that he must naturally hate me for who I am. He most likely thought exactly the same thing. You often see pictures of students in a picture and generally the black kids are together as a group. In the armed forces it’s the same. Is it because blacks don’t really trust white people? Yes. Is it because of the cultural gap? Yes. All races need to find common ground, then build upon that. Ask yourself. How many friends of different racial backgrounds do I have? I know I would like to have more. Find common ground. Build upon the friendship. Nurture it like a garden. As to the professor, thank you for your contributions to our society.

There's always backlash when people speak the truth, especially uncomfortable truths.  <br/><br/>That said, I think the critics here who take you to task for alluding to \"white America\" as some monolithic entity are accurate. As I read this piece, I kept waiting to hear how your students--all your students--reacted. There's very little about that in here. You return to the room and their heads are down. Were none of them appalled by what was written to you? Were none of them empathetic, sympathetic, concerned for your safety? You're going to get hate mail from the bigots and supremacists. There's no excuse for such violent hatred: it stems from viewing all black people as one monolithic entity.  ",

It required inner steeling and a sheer battle of will to steer an ambitious career course toward success in the work that I loved.

(I think they voted for trump) The history of America is rife with racial hatred. Much progress has been made. (Progressives) Much more needs to be done. (conservatives) Problem is, I think major problems are on the way with climate change. This will make continued progress in racial relations even harder to come by. Its sad. I thought this was a liberal, progressive country where everybody wanted the best for all of us. Its not. Tribalism and thuggery abound. And we profess to be christians?

Neither one is a monolith, but both are made up of God knows how many fragmented little communities.<br/><br/>I'm white, but other than skin color I have virtually nothing in common with millions - no, tens of millions - of white people across this country.  The most obvious example is any white person who voted for or supports Donald Trump or is Republican, but I'm sure there would be more subtle differences at play were I to pursue the matter.<br/><br/>In my career as a public school teacher in Los Angeles, I've worked under nine different principals, six of whom were black, and all of whom were vastly different.  One made the Wicked Witch of the West look like a Girl Scout, but another was one of the finest people I've ever met in my life.  If he opened a charter school in Hell and needed teachers, I'd volunteer.<br/><br/>I found \"Dear White America\" to be both pretentious and presumptuous, and I still do.

Barack Obama is a living profile in courage.  I could not have withstood a few minutes of the opprobrium that was heaped on him for 8 years.  Still, his deportment was exemplary, rational, fair, caring, loving.  Now look at the monstrosity we're saddled with.  A creature that sows hatred wherever he goes; whenever he speaks.  NOW I feel despair.  I'm Jewish, so when Trump described the white surpremacists in Charlottesburg as \"very find people,\" I took that as a declaration of war.  We're in the same boat, you and I (though I doubt you'd agree).  We're both persecuted minorities.  The Jews in Germany after WW I were part of the highest levels of society and royalty.  All that was swept away by the Nazis.  I have no illusions that if it suited his purpose, Trumpzilla would get rid of the Jews along with other minorities he'd like to throw or keep out of the US.  Of course he could keep his family members; even Hitler had the \"power\" to \"Aryanize\" anyone how chose.  Including Jews and persons of color.

It will require a different approach than that of confessing guilt and complicity.  Is Dr. King’s approach too outmoded?

          "commentBody": "Yesterday I read an article about a young black man who was sentenced to 65 years in prison for felony murder. The facts: he was 15 and part of a group of 5 teenagers who broke into a home to rob it. He was unarmed. The cops came, shot one of the teens and killed him. This was in Alabama, and as an accomplice to a felony (robbery), during which one person was killed, all the other kids get charged as adults and tried for murder--even though it was the cop who pulled the trigger.<br/><br/>What shocked me even more than the sentence were the comments by newspaper readers. Almost to a man they said the kid deserved such a sentence, hoped he'd get raped in prison, etc. The only thought that kept me from complete despair about this country was that those comments were written by the usual crew of gutless haters who post anonymously. Decent people sign their names.",

But I had the opportunity to have discussions with younger people who had the language and patience to work the old guy through it all. <br/><br/>But people who do not have this kind of opportunity, where do they they go to begin to develop their understanding of these issues? Certainly not most media where polarization and sensationalism dominate. Where do you go if you don't have access to a philosophy classroom or a group like I had? <br/><br/>This is where I feel a federal level Truth and Reconciliation Commission on racism would be immensely helpful. We need a place to acknowledge our shared history and build the language needed for people to be able to move forward. It needs a public stage that is above the petty polarization we see now, particularly on platforms like twitter that do not resemble anything like a discussion and seem to provide a platform for hate.

Virtually every man  believes himself and his actions to be good, so it is hard to face evidence of our own evil. We look for mitigating factors, and often blame the victim of our own evil. I don't think these instincts are reserved for just white people.<br/> On the other hand, the most important book that i have read in my life  was the autobiography of malcolm x which i read in my early 20s. From that time on I have viewed racism as america's great sin, and have done what I can to try to correct the hearts and minds of those I feel perpetuating that racism. i have raised my children to understand white privilege, and the importance of doing all that one can to change our system, most importantly by voting. Much of today's racism is institutional , and the greatest expression of racism is to pretend that it does not exist. As for your letters you must understand that in the age of the internet people take the time to rage , but rarely take the time to agree, or to offer solace. So your letters are from a very vocal minority.  I guess my point is that one book changed the arc of my life, and your words will do that for someone else. There is such a long way to go, but it seems to be much better than it was before. Not fair to you I know, but perhaps enough to let you remain hopeful?",

My children went to excellent colleges, much better than I could have gotten into, and I hope that my grandchildren, if any, will do even better.  My point is this change was achieved over multiple generations with a lot of hard work.  No one received special treatment.  Rather than give up on White America, perhaps you should look at what has made prior immigrant populations successful - hard work and perseverance.",

We are aware of the world around us, but our awareness is crippled by its narrowness. We only perceive the world through the filter of our “me-ness.” We can truthfully, yet sadly, joke, “I must be the center of the universe because everywhere I turn the universe is all around me.”<br/><br/>We cannot escape the constrictions imposed by our singular point-of-view, we only can only strive to limit them. Obviously some try harder than others, but no matter how much good will one brings to the task, one is absolutely constrained by an inability to truly see from someone else’s point of view. Even if we could, by some sort of technical wizardry, manage to perceive, for even an instant, another’s point of view, how could we hope to begin to share, much less assimilate, all of the life experiences that that person had stored up?<br/><br/>We also must face the reality that our DNA was forged when we lived in small groups and survived by maintaining a healthy distrust of the “others” from the next group over. As the planet metaphorically grows smaller and more connected, it behooves us to consider rejecting our instinctive defensiveness in favor of what we have in common, our humanness, and be more willing to work at bridging the gaps. This is scary stuff, but it starts by admitting our limitations, and then by recognizing that we share those limitations with every other person on the planet.",

As a white female who grew up in an upper-middle class family, I've lived a life of relative privilege in a lot of ways--I've never been afraid for my life when pulled over by a policeman, for instance. My grandfather went to college on the GI bill, which in turn enabled him to send his three sons to college, and by the time I was born it was simply a given that I would go too. <br/><br/>I've lived the better part of the last ten years out in Asia, which has given me a glimpse of what it's like to be in the minority as far as my skin color, and being the only white person on the bus while everyone stared at me. However, I never felt like those stares contained any hostility--literally everyone I talked to out there was friendly and curious about my home country. I'm sure that PoC in the United States don't always have such a positive experience.<br/><br/>In any case, as a white person, I don't know what it's like to be black or brown in the US and the best way I've found to learn is through writers such as yourself who write about their experiences. So I hope you continue to do so, and I'm grateful for what you've shared thus far.",

Growing up Jewish exposed me to a sample of the boundless hatred people are capable of, mostly through learned behavior from their parents and families.   <br/><br/>I cannot begin to imagine the impact such an onslaught of racial prejudice has upon someone's life and community. I can certainly recall events which chronicled glimpse of the strife; Watts, Detroit, Dr. King, the Panthers, Trevon Martin, Eric Garner.  My closest friends in high school were African American.  Being musicians allowed us to transcend the complications of race in a safe haven of a common passion.<br/><br/>White folks do things that are difficult for other white folks to understand. I am sorry you, your family and countless communities have had to endlessly defend and demand equal rights. Life during the Trump regime has been especially difficult for anyone of conscience, but together, we will emerge as a more perfect union. I need to believe this, and I hope you can too.    ",

It is held broadly by people ranging from arrant racists to moderately reasonable and benign suburban conservatives, to the otherwise fairly liberal. My wife, an early education teacher in a poor, mostly black community, even hears such sentiments voiced by some of her black colleagues. Rephrase the foregoing, eliminating the terms \"hoodrats\", \"pavement apes\" and \"whitey\", and you'd have expressed the view of a majority of white America and a not insignificant percentage of minority America.<br/><br/>Lately I've found myself pondering  the line from the beginning of Gatsby --<br/>\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\" he told me, \"just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.\"-- and thinking that there are two kinds of people in this country; those whose sympathies lie with Carroway's father perspective, and those whose do not. The latter have been in continual ascendancy among white Americans since the late '60s, waxing as the more overt manifestations of racism waned. This profound lack of empathy is at the core of contemporary Republican social thought and does more than anything else to explain their political successes. ",

No matter how nice &amp; neat it is for Yancy to declare all white people (it's unclear if he means around the world or just in the US) racist by being born white, it is a losing strategy. <br/><br/>White people, just like any other people, resent being lumped in with a group of people behaving badly, simply because of the color of their skin. <br/><br/>Yancy is either a fool to believe his biological essentialism message will be received gladly, or he's disingenuous and perhaps a publicity-monger who understands how offensive his message is, but doesn't care. <br/><br/>I suspect Yancy is much more interested in promoting the career of Yancy than in actually fixing the problem of race in America.",

His amplification of the politics of resentment and identity are exactly what my illiberal, Fox watching, Republican partisan acquaintances believe to be the essence of the liberal, NY Times reading, anti-Trump mindset.  <br/><br/>It is appalling that Prof. Yancy has received such angry, hateful responses to his columns.  It is unfortunate that his reaction is so angry and hateful.<br/><br/>Rather than putting things into perspective and considering great historical transformations including the abolition of slavery, the achievement of voting rights, the on-going integration of society, and the election of Barack Obama; Yancy fixates on hateful letters that he has received from a few (tens, hundreds ?) despicable ignoramuses out of a population of millions.<br/><br/>Philosophers from Socrates to Thomas Nagle have revealed the importance of transcending one's personal situation to achieve a just and reasonable appreciation of humanity.  Yancy's egotism and lack of appreciation for historical progress indicate that he has deviated from the path of those who strive to achieve wisdom.  Festering personal grievance is not wisdom.<br/><br/>Prof. Yancy would do well to read Steven Pinker's \"Enlightenment Now\".  Facts show that the human condition really has improved in the past 200 years and it continues to improve at an accelerating rate.  That goes for Africans, Asians, Europeans and Americans.  Maybe he'll cheer up.",

It’s so distressing to have to re-fight battles about civil rights—and indeed about civility in general—that should have been won decades ago. It will take a lot of effort to set things right, and there will be casualties.<br/>I’m not going to apologize for the unforgivably rude letters that Professor Yancy received, because I didn’t write any of them.

If you want people to take your ideas seriously stop using racism as a blunt instrument to shame them. It creates resentment and isn't persuasive. The redefining of racism  as \"implicit bias\" or \"structural racism\" is part of the problem. These concepts allow accusations of racism without any racist act or intention. They are akin to the religious concept of original sin or the secular one of collective guilt. These are invidious and odious attacks which drive people apart. They render real discussions impossible. Something you would think an academic would know. We have too many \"conversations\" about race in this country that are often irritating rebukes that accomplish nothing.

It is also important to know that such hatred isn't directed solely at black professors who speak their mind, but also at women and Latinos and Asians and Muslims and Jews and others.<br/><br/>While black Americans have a claim to having been uniquely wronged in the past, the racist, sexist and xenophobic wrongs of today are shared by many people.<br/><br/>When it comes to privilege it's inaccurate and frankly racist to simply say that \"white people\" enjoy privileges that black people don't without acknowledging that racist privilege is on a spectrum tied very much to place. In most of America a black man and woman walking down a street hand in hand wouldn't be noticed at all, but two white men doing the same thing would be subject to verbal abuse and possibly worse. A Korean grocer in Compton is subject to racial abuse every day... from black people.<br/><br/>Blacks can claim the horrors of the middle passage, slavery and Jim Crow.  But racism and racist privilege are not uniquely black and white experiences.<br/><br/>Let's learn and acknowledge history and then move forward by rededicating ourselves to the proposition that all people are created equal.",

(Maybe it was not chosen by the author.) It's idiotic. It's hatred that we must conquer, and hate has no color. Like many people, I've been the victim of bigotry all my life. I've been shouted at, and sometimes even beaten, by people of all skin tones. But as a child I was also saved from an attack by some dark kids by another dark kid. I went home with him and had dinner with his family. His Mother apologized to me in the sweet tones of loving Mothers everywhere. Some people are good, some are not. As soon as we line them up by color, then hate has a foot in the door. <br/><br/>This column reeks of self hatred. So I would change the headline to: \"Should I Give Up On Myself?\" The answer is of course No. As Mark Twain sort of said:  We are all human beings...and I can't think of anything worse. <br/><br/>I wish you the best.",

I find that offensive.<br/><br/>2. You read the comments to your class because you wanted their empathy/sympathy for how you were feeling. The job of a professional is not to inflict their personal troubles with the people paying them. I'm not entitled to do with to my clients either - they have their own problems with life, they don't to pay to hear mine.  This is similar to another article in the NY Times where a lecturer was asking if she should share the fact that she suffers from depression with the class.  No it's not appropriate - but do share it with love ones and friends. They are the ones you should go to for support.",

Maybe instead your experiences reflect the recent seismic shifts in how we communicate online (all of those shifts tending toward amplifying the extreme nastiness of the most deranged and hideous few). <br/><br/>Most white racism is not KKK foaming at the mouth hatred, it's more like having brunch for the thousandth time with your entirely white group of friends in a formerly black, gentrified neighborhood: cluelessly enjoying privileges that disadvantage black people. Is that seriously problematic and harmful? Yes. Is that equivalent to lynching? No, and it's probably not helpful to pretend they're equivalent, either, because every white girl brunching knows in her heart that she is not a member of the KKK. So misdiagnosing the main problem gives her too easy of a defense. The serious problems of institutional racism and white privilege in 2018 are not reflected in those awful emails. ",

Despite what you may have considered weakness in your classroom that day, what you did was an act of honor and of courage. You said, “No matter how much this hurts me, I can’t stoop to their level.”  This is the dignity of the black people in America, which they have displayed since the first slave was sold on these shores. Maybe you’ve had enough...and I think you have. In 1969 I sat in the student union at the University of Illinois having lunch with five strangers, one of whom was a black man.  I asked him to pass the salt.  He looked at me with fierce anger and didn’t pass the salt.  I couldn’t understand it.  All I had done was ask for the salt.  I thought about it for years, then I realized:  it was a hate stare. ",

You are an example of integrity and profound courage and we should all be listening. <br/><br/>I respectfully disagree with you on one point, Professor Yancy: I don’t believed you “failed” when losing your composure during that one moment in class. Quite the contrary. Seeing that their teacher has human emotions in the face of the unspeakable violence and ugliness of those letters is entirely appropriate. (And I say this as a university professor who teaches daily and who studies teaching pedagogy.) Your students received an education that day which will last far longer than a lecture filled with statistics. ",

None by my friends, because I would never keep acquaintance with such people. I can think of no one I knew to be a racist who otherwise was someone of good qualities that I would want as a friend. Even at a young age I knew such attitudes were wrong and in so many cases were not even based on direct interaction with anyone of color. But over the years I was aware of the fact that despite my feelings that I also harbored a degree of racism, albeit unintentional. But I saw that it was there. I think the incident at Starbucks where people saw something invisible where we take it for granted that we can wait somewhere for friends to arrive before placing an order may have broken through the awareness in others. <br/><br/>But there is something you overlooked. Fear. Fear is a powerful force. Fear is something that the racists have long employed not only on the objects of their hatred but as well as of those of their own. It is revealed in the \"lover\" used as an adjective. And the subject noun is usually a derisive version of the people they hate. Nouns you used in your essay, but that would be flagged in a comment. Indian lover. Black lover. Queer lover. Those who stand up for others are seen as traitors and earn the same level of hatred that you have received. “White innocence” is sometimes a result of the same forces you experience.",

There are celebrities who receive these kinds of responses daily for subjects far more innocuous and far less important than race relations.  You'd have to be living in a bubble to not have noticed this, and come up with strategy for dealing with it.  You can't apply data analysis to it, because you can't assume that 30 or 50 or 90% hate mail has any translation to the real world.  Most people who handle it well realize they can't take this kind of feedback personally.  It's soul-crushing if you do, and it's also wrong because it doesn't provide an accurate picture.  Prof Yancy should do himself a favour and educate himself on this.<br/><br/>That said, I agree with the larger point that there is a malaise in dealing with racism because people don't see themselves, or want to admit, they are racists.  Personally I don't quite know how to deal with that other than what I already do:  know how lucky I am, support civil rights and equality of treatment for everyone, call out racist behaviour when I see it, and be otherwise vocal and vigilant.",

We need to keep working at the level of fighting racist discourse and empowering people of all races, sexes, etc., but also look at where this deeper ugliness comes from--this desire to cause suffering, to see people erased just because of some personal trait.

That there are some ugly people who spout ugly words does not result in the conclusion that we are all racists.....at heart......somehow.<br/><br/>My first playmate was a black boy, Woody, in Veteran's Village in Ames, Iowa.  My parents took a lot of grief from some people for befriending them (taking them shopping with us because they didn't have a car).  My father about Woody's father:  \"He fought too.\" <br/><br/>Mr. Yancy would read this as a rationalization (e.g., \"I have black friends!\"), but maybe he needs to open his own heart a little and explore whether his anger is blinding him.  Maybe most people aren't racist---maybe most people just go about their own lives thinking about themselves and their own families first, and then other people second.  Probably like he does.<br/><br/>So, instead of being racist, or sexist, I'm \"everybody-but-my-family-ist.\"  It's not personal.<br/><br/>Mr. Yancy shot the first volley.  He may have used fancy language, and some of those who shot back may have used less fancy language.  But both languages, his and theirs, are equally ugly and \"something-ist.\"",

Western values of hard work, patience, preparation, reflect this setting.  African cultures have different values (I have two black nieces who both dropped out of college to have children by random guys-- a value choice).  When I hear African Americans name-calling me, I do not feel under attack.  I feel that they are expecting some sort of behavior from me.  This is a culturally-based expectation on their part.  To me it seems submissive.  They \"want something\" from me.  I want them to do their own thing, without making demands.   If it was really about \"white privilege,\" Jews and Asian-Americans would not succeed as they do, and Africa (no \"white privilege\" there), would be as advanced as Europe, Israel, or East Asia.",

Not that you are any worse than most other academics. In fact, you probably learned it from the white professors who taught you when you were an undergraduate. <br/><br/>Human nature is inherently tribal and territorial, but for reasons of ideology and power-politics, instead of seeking to understand this, academics teach us to trivialise, ridicule or demonise it instead. <br/><br/>If you disrespect someones sense of tribal identity, it is likely to make them angry and aggressive, which you misinterpret as hatred. <br/><br/>Most people, naturally enough and including myself, do not, deep down, identify with other races as belonging to the same tribe or nation as themselves. It is as simple as that, but complicated by the fact that the state demonises such feelings as \"racist\", making them difficult to admit to. It would cost an aspiring academic and many other professions their career.<br/><br/>If we were allowed to admit to our true feelings, we could learn to deal with them, consciously, in a more rational and civilised fashion, But as it is, the state forces us to deny and suppress them, in order to deceitfully pose as our tribe or nation itself.<br/><br/>This is a profoundly important issue which academics &amp; philosophers should be on to, but as privileged clients and employees of the state themselves they are reluctant to go near it.",

Fear and hatred of other people based on ethnic and cultural markers is universally human, what makes American racism so toxic is the power differential between whites and all other people, with blacks of course bearing the worst of the oppression that comes with unequal power.  You have every right to withdraw from the ugly battlefield, you did not make the battle or feed the ugliness and it is white America's responsibility to curb and banish their own worst demons.

I saw blacks treated worse then me. I was poor, a girl, but I was white.  I knew what I'd come from and elected to study it in college, making it my minor, in fact.  I was hopeful then. But I know it's worse today for blacks than it was after Rodney King when even the video tape proved irrelevant in the face of a mostly white jury pool of ex civil servants &amp; police officers. The world is transparent now, with more exacting video evidence still not enough to prove the pervasive, violent, and corrupt magnitude of our own racism. I don't know why Mr. Yancy is so surprised and hurt.  He should know better. Until the power structure at the top and the bottom reflects the myriad of colors and experiences underneath, without preference as to economic and legacy standing, I don't believe racism can be eradicated. White power won't allow it.  It's the same for women too. We lack the economic and political power to effect change.  All the major pillars of our world are still controlled by white men.

I never write comments let alone read responses as so often people express such horrific thoughts under the anonymity of the internet, but I felt compelled to write a message of support and appreciation after reading. I have often felt like I do not have a right to speak out on issues of race, as a white person. But your piece has made me realize that what I do have is a moral responsibility to speak out, as best I can, in the face of this unconscionable hatred expressed by other members of my ethnic/racial group. It cannot only be the responsibility of black Americans to educate white America and to combat this hatred. Every good person must stand up and send the message that this is not acceptable. I have long found comfort in a belief in progress, but it terrifies me that this poison has been emboldened in our current political moment. I want a better world for all of us, and I want to be a part of the solution. ",

My mother was a Catholic born of immigrant parents and my father an atheist also born of immigrant parents. My mother was raised by her racist parents and my father by his racist mother (his father died while my father was very young). My father was in the Air Force during WWII and subsequently stationed there after the war.  He had the opportunity to meet many different people from many different cultures. He taught his children that we were growing up in a shrinking world and we had better learn how to respect and get along with all kinds of people.<br/><br/>Do I have racist tendencies, of course, I think that most of us do. We humans seem to be naturally suspicious of those we perceive as different from ourselves. Left alone there is little to challenge our bigotries.

I could not get out of bed every morning if I believed that such hate is in the majority among whites.  <br/><br/>More common, I believe, are 2 things:  1.  a general lack of awareness of ones own white privilege compared to black America's - probably driven in large part by institutional segregation in housing.  How can we reach out to each other when our kids don't go to school together and we don't live next door?  That's the only way I meet people in my life these days.  The unfortunate outcome of this separation is a lack of understanding and acceptance of the differences in culture - which can be very localized.  I moved to the Midwest from the west coast and I felt like I was always making mistakes and didn't \"get\" the cultural differences (but being white, I was always forgiven). <br/><br/>The 2nd item is fear, that I believe is part of our broken human nature.  Having visited evil upon black people, whites are afraid that the impulse for revenge is in every black heart.  I think this actually represents a form of a mirror - in our hearts we would want revenge if someone did evil to us, so we fear blacks for that reason.   (Jesus' call to turn the other cheek takes powerful character, which I see most blacks demonstrate daily).<br/>The best I know how to do is to raise my kids to defend the humanity in all people and to always be kind.

How America got to this notion of white racial superiority escapes every aspect of reason and moral sensibility.<br/>I am in my late 60’s, and the point I want to make is that our children and their children do not see ethnicity the way older generations do. It IS becoming extinct (where thinking people live). Educating people that enjoy being uneducated is the biggest challenge, I believe.  Our children and their children with non-white friends described them simply as “friends” without further description, because they have been taught, and understand that no further difference exists.<br/>You nor I will see racism in America disappear in our lifetimes but the change I have witnessed in the past 30 years is well beyond the 170 years prior and will continue as our offspring understand that we are truly one. It is quite possible that you don’t see this but as a white guy that grew up surrounded by racism I see it nearly every day. All the best,",

We need \"satyagraha\" in America to cleanse the social evil - a grass root movement of \"fasting\" and \"singing\" together on every community.

I've made choices to surround myself and my children with people of different races and classes when most of the people I grew up with have fled to the suburbs or private schools. I take my family to Civil Rights museums, show them speeches of civil rights leaders, and talk to them about colonialism and slavery. I don't say this to be sanctimonious or self-righteous. I just want you to know that not all white people are indifferent and accepting of the white supremacist culture of our country. I have a long way to go, but I'm trying to do what I can to educate myself and my family and act on that knowledge. It won't happen in the next generation, or the next, but one day this will be better. ",

Tortured over hours by cruel, mocking, brutal men, they finally murdered him and dragged his body to the site of his alleged crime.  A crowd of around 1500 people had been waiting for Mr. Neal for hours there, and when they learned he was past the infliction of further pain, they rioted into the black sections of town, beating and threatening anyone they could find.  Neal's body was hanged from the tree before the courthouse; photographs of his pitiful body sold as postcards in the local drug store for decades.  Investigators who came to the area dozens of years later were presented with grisly trophies taken from Neal's body, preserved as relics or rewards for valor.<br/><br/>These events occurred in my home state of Florida.  In 1934, my grandmother - an undeniably good and Christian woman - lived only a few hours drive away.  She would have heard of Claude Neal's murder, everyone did.  Did her minister mention it from the pulpit, and did he support the mob or the murdered man?  Did she read of it in the papers?  Speak of it with friends, or to her husband?  Most likely, she would have shook her head and turned her thoughts to less distressing events.  <br/><br/>That's what we do.  And exactly what we shouldn't do.  Racism didn't die in the '60s, and it needs our attention and our disgust today.  I loved my grandmother, but I won't emulate her.",

We thought we had come so far since the civil rights movement but clearly we have a lot of work to do.  We may never completely end racism but we can certainly do better than we've done this far.  <br/><br/>I'd like to thank people like professor Yancey who have forced me to acknowledge my own hidden bias.  I thought that because I have friends who are people of color that automatically proved that I wasn't racist.  But my family is from the south and my mom is racist and some of her attitudes have been passed on to me.  My job is to acknowledge that those biases are within me and to reject them when they surface.",

He would do better - I believe - if he attempted to unite African Americans in common cause with poor and working-class whites against a ruling class that is oppressing both in part by keeping them at each other's throats.",

In terms of income, they magically make over 200% of the income of most other ethnic groups (and magically avoid paying their income taxes appropriately), and they dominate the university system with their \"high expectation\" parent-pleasing, overachieving mentality.  They are buying up all of the most expensive properties in California (because they are the only ethnic group who can afford them), and I assume, in other parts of the country.  Many East Asians I interact with exhibit a hyper-racism and Confucianist conservatism that does not jibe well with western liberal democratic thinking.  It is authoritarian, un-empathic (emphasizing \"losers\" and \"winners,\" not \"victims\" and \"privileged\").  It is a type of thinking that predominates my wife's Chinese family, and it led many in her family to vote for and see as ideal someone like Trump.  It also led to events like the recent protest by wealthy East and South Asians in Orange County to protest the building of temporary housing for the homeless there.  (The homeless are \"threatening\" and \"losers\" in their eyes.)  My question:  Should I give up on trying to persuade these groups of people that they can still be secure and empathic at the same time?  ",

In order to disregard the humanity of their human property they have to remove something vital to their own being. <br/><br/>However, the white man has been able for many long years to convince himself of his own righteousness. Look to the silver screen and you will be certain to see him perpetually cast in the role of hero when in reality the white man is no more heroic or villainous than the rest of us. Now the black man been given redress by various platforms to hold up the disagreeable mirror to the white man, who doesn't like what he sees. He sees a monster, the abyss, and not recognizing himself he lashes out. And people like Prof. Yancy feel the sting. <br/><br/>People such as these with their vile insults and threats are contemptible, almost pitiable. Their words are ugly and hurtful, no doubt, but hold not an ounce of truth. The God who judges such things will hold them to account, and now finally so will we. Stay the course, Prof. Yancy.

As a staunchly militant  Black woman, I have my days hating white folks because of the brutality of racism, but then when my black tenant refuses to pay her rent, or another Black woman distrusts me or hates me because I have naturally long hair, it puts me on the fence as to who is my enemy.  So I've resigned myself to the following: \"give up\" on unrighteous people, ungodly people.  The problem is not just racism, or as Mary J. Blige would say, haterism, but ungodliness.

On and on.  Our interior, positive identity, “X,” is almost equally defined and maintained in opposition, as “Not X.”   No Bueno.<br/><br/>I will, however, most humbly and with utter deference to the truth of Mr. Yancy’s ongoing pain, offer one up for white people.  The brilliant, mythic writer Barry Lopez was giving a talk on the British 1845 Franklin Expedition into the artic which left all 129 men dead.  Their decisions serve as a virtual compendium of white hubris and arrogance.  At the end he was asked if he had any hope for white people.  Lopez replied with the usual; cathedrals, symphony orchestras etc.  But when pressed for something hopeful in the last couple of centuries, Lopez thought more.  Finally, he said that in his broad travels he often found that, whatever was going on, there was, off to the side, a white person watching, noting, trying to understand, trying to fit whatever was going on into a bigger picture.  With hope, as we spiral madly towards any number of ends where the solution depends on us universally evolving beyond these illusions, this white quirk will play a positive role.  Love.",

When you grow up in a community of people who are decent and respectful, you think almost everyone must be the same. Reading comments to articles in other online periodicals has shown me that is not the case. Scary and sad.<br/><br/>Second, I live in a country, Colombia, that has very low levels of racism. I think that is because the majority of the people are some shade of brown, although there are some people with pale skin and some with dark skin. Even the same family can have a range of skin colors. It is hard to be a racist when you have pale skin and your sister has dark skin.

I’m so sorry to hear of the vitriolic racist responses to your 2015 essay. I just read it now for the first time.<br/><br/>Yes, sadly, I think you should give up on us. But not for the reasons you list. People don’t send hate mail because they deem you irrelevant. They send it because they recognize the truth in your words and can’t admit it. We white people are in such deep denial that most can’t hear a word you say.<br/><br/>You say I’m indifferent. I disagree. I’m overwhelmed. Working against gun violence, rape, war and environmental destruction. Working to raise my kids, improve their education and keep our family afloat. There’s little room left in my heart to think about race. I recognize that option is itself a form of privelege. But it’s not indifference.<br/><br/>As a queer, a Jew and a survivor, I’ve embraced my minority roles because I don’t want to accept my culpability. But I am also a white male. I know I’ve benefitted from this system rigged in my favor. I’m grateful for the reminder my debts.<br/><br/>You’ve planted a lot of good seeds; now is the time to nourish them. Encourage white people like me—awake but overwhelmed—to take the neeeded steps to become allies. Many men hear from other men about sexism better than they can hear it from women. I think the parallel is true for race. I need to speak up and give you a chance to rest.<br/><br/>So yes, please give up on us for now, but not forever.",

All those deprecated \"white liberals\" support Dr. Yancy in his day-to-day struggle with racism. However he has to know that the hatemail was written by trolls and perhaps Trumpites-- not privileged whites. He's a credentialed professor, and he's not mandated to diminish the capacity of anyone to have an informed judgement based on race. To expose the reality of racism through evidence is to educate people in 'white privilege'. You don't have to call it that, and you're wrong to label students as racially 'privileged'. They either learn it by themselves or they don't. His message, as expressed here, is coercive, more Orwell and Chairman Mao than MLK. ",

Personally, I think racism is part of classism, sexism, ageism, ableism. i.e. oppression. Oppression is not just about black-white relations, anymore than it is about male-female relations; it is more of a power dynamic: what voices matter more in our democracy?<br/>One of my watershed moments was when attending an annual National Conference on Race and Ethnicity in New York City, 2012—attendees were asked to separate into African American, Asian-Pacific Islander, Latino, Native American, etc. caucasus, but the focus was on black-white relations.  When I raised this concern, I was told by fellow attendees that black American narratives 'come first' because they or us have been 'at this battle longer.' We have all, in some way or another, been part of an imposed battle of 'who comes first, whose voices matter more, and whose experiences count'.  It is time to change our narrative altogether.<br/>I am so very sorry you were hurt in this evolving exchange.  In my own experience, if you speak out against power, what can be done to you is of little to no consequence of what can be done to your family and friends—what happens when we begin to personalize injustice, be the masochist, martyr.  Thank you for refusing either role--and  let's hope we can learn to refuse those roles as well!  ",

I climbed my way out, and when I got to an elite private law school I realized that I had little in common with the privileged white kids, and in fact deeply resented their sense of entitlement. It turns out that by then \"my people\" didn't look anything like me. <br/><br/>But I was keenly aware of how lucky I was every time someone had given me an opportunity in life because I seemed like a kid who was going place, or because they thought I deserved it. And I noticed that this continued to happen in law school, but not equally for everyone. Even educated people who believe they are not racist hire those who \"will be a good fit\" at their firm, which means they're just like everyone else there.<br/><br/>My kids are now in a school we chose largely for its diversity program. I have pointed out that we send our kids and our money there not just so that kids of color can see others like them succeed, but so that my son can see that success is not his entitlement. We don't progress until those receiving privilege recognize that it's wrong. Serving on the diversity committee reminds me of the need for dialogue on both sides, and sometimes gives me hope.

Whites enslaved individuals because of their skin color; later terrorized them and stripped them of their constitutional right to vote; denied them equal access to a quality education; used banking practices and government regulations to confine them to ghettos; judged them by their skin color rather than their individual qualifications when  they applied for a job; and committed other acts of discrimination I lack the space to list.

Some of them are good people who are very attuned to racist activities and have made a point of displaying their frustration with the persistence of racism in the US. I would have liked for you to point out that racism is a universal phenomenon. Racism is the product of the interaction of many different races, sects and ethnic groups with their own sometimes intense sense of identity. Black people in Africa and around the  world are prone to the same racism, violence and bigotry as other racial groups. We are no better and no worse than white people. We have been victimized by slavery and maligned unfairly in this country. But we should not revert to treating all white people the same and painting them unfairly with the same simpleminded racist brush that some of them have historically applied to us. Yes, racism is bad. But no group is entitled to claim exclusively the moral high ground on the matter of race in this complex country. ",

She's grown up in a heterogeneous society. Her friends, boyfriends, workmates and patients have been of all colors and backgrounds; and I've seen her be outspoken and proactive against injustice and unfair treatment towards others. This isn't hype or self-righteous behavior. It's who she is. And I think there are many more white people coming up in the next generation who are like her.

Or how our long history of racial injustice has created power, educational and particularly economic structures that divide us. What we needed after the Civil War was something like a truth and reconciliation commission that would have stopped the perpetuation of the lie that slavery was a benign institution. If you’re white you’re brought up to believe that this country is “a shining city on a hill” that’s a democratic model for the world. Why do we have this need for the self-image of national exceptionalism instead of the instilled desire for constant honest reappraisal and adjustments to achieve the exceptional and rise above our history instead of hide its uglier truths? There’s nothing more toxic to any psyche, national or individual.",

Why can't we start consider ourselves to be one race--human--since so many of us have decided to marry one another without regard to former racial or ethnic taboo?  As a nation we are moving strongly in that direction and racial terms will become increasingly meaningless.",

Listen to these people who have been enslaved, tortured and killed by white Americans during the entire course of the country's history.

These were attempts to talk about the numerous times my family, friends and neighbors  were targets of hate and violence because they were white folks who dared to live in  the neighborhood and have their kids attend Detroit schools.  Raising these issues makes liberals go ballistic.<br/>In terms of my family's experiences in Detroit, my father was assaulted and left partially disabled as he stepped off a bus returning home from work. He didn't drive a car.  He was a person, 62 years old, who didn't consider our neighborhood a ghetto or slum.  He never returned to work. He was the victim of a racist attack. Words were spoken to him about being white.  The perpetrators imagined they had the right to do this because of my father's skin color. <br/><br/>There are other experiences that involve murder and arson which I would like to share in an open discussion about race relations in the US.  The violence is not a one-way street.<br/>When we attempted to protect ourselves we heard the shouts \"Look, white supremacists!\"  coming from many liberals living a safe distance away. Any mention of our experiences was deemed racist. We eventually did  move out (\"white flight!\").<br/>Our family has  done well without any imagined generations of wealth contrary to the current false racial dichotomy.<br/>An open discussion will never occur.",

As a white man, I've come to believe transformation among white people will ultimately come from discourse among white people themselves (racism's most common posture is defensiveness). But remember that \"whiteness\" and \"blackness\" are ultimately stand-in terms for positions within a power structure, not ontological states. Asking if you should give up on  \"white people\" is to ask if you should give up speaking truth to power. Of course, power comes in many forms and some whites are rendered powerless in some arenas of the social order, but never by virtue of their \"whiteness\" (a fact which a few comments here seem to still not get by conflating the notion of racial \"privilege\" with other types of privilege). There are a lot of racist white people, and any fantasies we harbored that we were making great strides to end racism over time, or that there was such a thing as inevitable \"progress,\" were (ironically) dashed with the ascension of President Obama whose mere existence unleashed dormant demons. <br/><br/>Sadly, your message won't change much on a broad scale. But every year you have access to white students who can benefit from your wisdom. Never stop speaking to them. Work on ways to help them see how power works in the world, and see the mythologies that arise from these power systems (racial, gendered, class-based, etc.). Your frustrations are understandable.

In so doing, you provide a role model for your students and for all of us, for which I thank you. I am not sure, however, that affixing labels is a good tool for learning. Rather, we need to get behind the labels to an understanding that, no matter how hard we try to overcome their impact, structural racism (and misogyny) are woven into the fabric of our lives. To overcome the impact of that, even in small respects, requires an ongoing struggle from which we can never rest.

I admire George Yancy in both capacities, and I think he is doing great things in the ways he addresses pervasive racism in American society and philosophy, with possibilities that philosophy may help us think some of this through. Every day we discover new ways in which racism--not just black and white racism--is profoundly corrosive to our lives--both black and white.<br/><br/>Having said this, however, I must protest this piece, however touching, however deeply people have wounded Yancy. There are no \"white people\" and there are no \"black people\" even as the corrosiveness of racist violence continues its horrors.",

And, as has always been the case, reforms that focus on structural racism benefit whites as well.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the way we may even touch white hearts and help them understand the ways in which racism has reduced their humanity just as it has ours.<br/><br/>But for now, I'll accept that as a byproduct rather than a goal.",

Racism is universal and a group placed in the higher status will work on maintaining the status quo, consciously or not.

People everywhere have been brainwashed or accepting of unfounded (and disproven) notions of superiority, turning to ancient tribal instincts, in Africa, in Europe, in the U.S...<br/><br/>The approach I have to disagree with on \"Dear White America\" is the extent of shaming, since there are many liberals and progressives who have long taken a lot flack from conservatives from their stances against racism. Yes, it can't compare to what African Americans go through daily, but there are many white people fighting for change.<br/><br/>I believe racism is an instinct in all of us, that we constantly have to be aware of and over rule with rational thought. Being honest with these sides to ourselves is part of overcoming them. Better integration would also help, turning outsiders we never met growing up into insiders who have been part of our communities.",

What distinguishes white fear from other cultures and makes it such a virulent, aggressive type? <br/><br/>I would answer: the concept of innocence, especially childhood innocence. For whites, a child (even the unborn child) is an innocent about to be victimized by the evils of the world, the worst evil being bad people. (Whites long ago \"conquered\" nature.) The innocent need protection, and it is the \"noble\" duty of the man to protect, through aggression, the innocents within his society. The next step is to define the \"bad\" people. We all know how that goes.<br/><br/>This concept of innocence helps explain many of the attitudes of the conservative base, such as those towards crime, abortion and education. But the innocence/protection dichotomy is deeply imbedded in white (some would say WEIRD) culture and is also a reason why so-called liberals often fail, in the end, to address racist attitudes that lead to segregated or unequal neighborhoods and schools.<br/><br/>There's a great deal of information on contrasting notions of childhood, child-rearing and the concept of innocence available on the web. The paradox is that this notion, derived perhaps from Judeo-Christian notions, while perpetuating hate, has also been an important factor in the development of modern political institutions.",

          "commentBody": "It's almost impossible to grow up in a predominately white community in the US and not absorb racist stereotypes about blacks. Virulent, overt racism of the type Yancy describes is now relatively rare (though I fear growing). But there are many white Americans who are just as virulently racist but keep their thoughts hidden to avoid appearing racist. These Americans may make a racist comment or snicker at one someone else makes if they feel they are in a safe space. If they're educated, they might defend Charles Murray as a man unafraid to speak truth to political correctness. They believe blacks are inferior, but don't want to jeopardize their respectability by marching with tiki torches. <br/><br/>There's an even larger group of white Americans who accept racist stereotypes without acknowledging or recognizing that they do and who will insist if challenged that they are not racist. These Americans tend to deny racism exists at all anymore. In some ways, they are the most dangerous of all as their denial of racism allows it to fester while also delegitimizing any fight against it. <br/><br/>These three groups of whites probably constitute two-thirds to three-quarters of the white population, which is why Yancy's frustration is so justified. Most of the remainder of the white population (including me) also has absorbed racist stereotypes, but at least tries to fight them off. A few may truly not be racist. <br/><br/>Most adult whites may indeed be beyond hope—but let's not give up on their kids.",

In short (though I won't do it justice with this summary):<br/><br/>Ten thousand years ago, it made sense to be wary of strangers who wandered into your valley for the threat they might pose to you and your kin. This was especially true if they looked very different from you, indicating that they had traveled far and were therefore formidable. This means that deep inside our brain, there are evolutionary mechanisms of xenophobia. Scientific research has confirmed this in, for example, studies where little babies show a preference for faces that match their own skin color.<br/><br/>This mechanism translates into discrimination and racism in our modern world and we see it everywhere. Wherever there is a minority, that group is on the receiving end of discrimination and racism. Whether it is African-Americans in the US, the Chinese in Malaysia or indeed the Whites in Zimbabwe.<br/><br/>The conclusion of all this is that the xenophobic urges we carry around deep within our DNA can only be overcome by our intellect and our willingness to reach out to 'the other'. Familiarity destroys fear, friendliness destroys hatred.<br/><br/>The good news is that we are all capable of reaching out. The sad news is that every generation will need to be taught to do this, because our evolutionary heritage isn't going away any time soon. <br/><br/>We all have the responsibility to raise our children in this light.",

I'm continually horrified by what I read in the news (particularly The Root: a great source for educating one's white self on the mind-boggling multitude of racist crimes going on in America. It is also a great source for white people to hear and understand black perspective, implicit bias, the racism inherent in being white). If there is any doubt that there are white people who become nauseous and enraged when another black child is shot by a white homeowner/police, when black men are arrested for merely existing, when black women are judged by any emotion they show, know that there are. But getting nauseous &amp; enraged is not enough. I urge white people who recognize the blatant, systemic and implicit racism in our country to do something about it. Read, read, read. Talk to your white children about how they can knock on a stranger's door for directions and NOT get shot, but black children don't have that privilege. Talk to your elderly white parents \"of a different generation\" about how you will be on the right side of justice in today's civil rights movement. Question people who say \"all lives matter,\" asking them why they are upset about the semantics of a slogan rather than upset about the racist crime people are protesting about. Join a local racial justice group, like SURJ or Black Lives Matter (and make your fight against racism about equality, and not about you). ",

You know who alerted the world about it? A white woman. You know who stood up for them in the moment? A white man. Should you give up on them?<br/><br/>I think we have to reframe the issue of racism. It is not about people being good or bad--it's about power imbalance predicated on external factors. Those factors can include race, but also encompass gender, orientation etc. In other words, victims of this power imbalance come in many flavors. The question really is--what can we do to eradicate this imbalance?<br/><br/>You could argue education etc, but we all know that's not accurate. All the education and grit in the world cannot change the imbalance alone. To do that, we need to call out the dynamic when we see it at work as to make all aware of it. It is the only cure.<br/><br/>You see an incident of racism? Speak out. Shine a light. You see an incident of sexism, homophobia, fat shaming, transphobia? Same.<br/><br/>That requires MORE OF US in the boat, not less.<br/><br/>The problem with your approach is that you would kick people out of your boat for external factors, regardless of the fact many of us are on your side, fighting the same fight.<br/><br/>How about this? Judge us not by the color of our skin and call upon us all to do same. Let's demand together, jointly, wholly for social justice and let's be the change we seek.",

As a music teacher, I try to make a difference in the lives of my students by helping them to become better musicians, and I find this work very rewarding.  The point is, I don't feel that I need to look at everything all around me all the time, and react to the injustices that I see and hear about far away.  Of course, if something happens right in front of me, that's different.  You talk about giving up on white people.  But in your day to day life, in your day to day interactions with people of all colors, is your experience that every white person you deal with treats you badly?  I really wonder about that.  And if not, if many white people you interact with actually treat you decently, as of course they should, then where does this \"giving up on white people\" idea come from?",

Not surprisingly that is a very common definition across all lines. Across every culture we have been taught to stay with “our own kind”, but that teaching is steadily being overridden by people falling in love or befriending or socializing with “the other”. This is a good trend that will continue and which will win the battle against the bigots who want to keep us all separated. I’m glad you haven’t given up despite the difficulty of enduring the daily paper cuts of indignity. Love does, in fact, conquer all and it will conquer this too. Keep the faith and keep strong, you are fighting the good fight. ",

I have never been able to comprehend how or why many liberals are afraid to decry racism as the single greatest problem in America.

That hatred produced Trump.  It came within a hair of electing Roy Moore.   How do we deal with the issue?  Ultimately, I fear that countless generations must come and go before real change occurs.  In the interim, we most force what little change is possible at the polls.  Elect legislators who will force change and appoint judges who will enforce change. ",

I want an America where people realize that extending the good to all people enhances the good of all.

But I'm genuinely confused: deep down, does Dr. Yancy still think this is the rhetorical technique best suited to convincing a skeptical, or even a hostile, audience of white readers of the righteousness of his argument?",

I was hit on the knees with pipes (my children) to drop my school bag; shoved down the subway steps to grab my handbag; threatened with a knife for my wallet; followed too closely by young men taunting me; my father was robbed in his office and tied to a chair; my mother was scared to walk home from the subway after dark; doors were triple locked with police locks; we had our fathers and brothers sitting in the hall with baseball bats guarding the lobby at night  - the list goes on and on.  I was taught to keep tokens and ten dollars in my pockets in case I was mugged; to never walk an empty street; to never be out at night; to stay in a group; to always lock the car doors - again the list goes on.

Society can destroy itself by being detached and non-critical. Human history reveals over and over again that as much as we might wish to retreat to the sole comfort of group identity (racial, cultural, economic, religious, political), in the end, we need one another in order to achieve our selves. To give up on others means that we give up on the possibility of achieving a richer, better version of a self that only truly becomes a self through communion, not separation. Indeed, it is premature and presumptuous to \"give up\" on an entire race of people. In the life of the universe we know that human kind is a relatively recent and flawed experiment. Let's give one another more time before we make absolute judgements about one another. As a species we are rather new in the neighborhood. ",

I hear this comment all the time, especially from older whites who are of Irish/Polish/Italian/Jewish/Greek/other Southern/non-Northern European heritage, but it is a specious comparison. No matter how \"nonwhite, foreign and other\" we may have been considered initially to native born Northern European heritage whites, we became white when compared to African Americans. In a way I think immigration is partly to blame for what happened to African Americans after Reconstruction. If black labor had been used to man the factories of the North and Midwest instead of encouraging immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe, we would be much farther along than we are.  So great was the fear of the Southern Negro, it was preferable to import labor from abroad. Had my ancestors not been paid to come from Lithuania to work in Woonsocket, RI, it would have been Southern Blacks instead. History is far more complicated than you make it out to be. ",

But, there is a difference between personal bias and racism, which is systemic, codified in our institutions and policies.  In that respect, racism is ALWAYS about white people.  White racial bias is reinforced and made more potent by using it as a basis for laws and social policies.  This is the analysis that has grown out of over 30 years of critical race theory.  Racism is personal AND systemic.  Personal bias is not.  Black people can be prejudiced or biased against whites - they can even hate us - but their bias will not result in us having a harder time getting an education, a job, a house or medical care.  It will not result in white people getting pulled over more by police or killed and incarcerated in disproportionate numbers.  It will not be woven into all the institutions of this nation.  That is the difference.  You want Professor Clancy to \"tone it down\", but it is essential that we look honestly at the impact of structural racism and how racial bias against black people is enacted in a white supremacy in ways which disadvantage black people in all areas of life, including lowering life expectancy.  I know it is hard to hear without getting defensive, but there is nothing unreasonable about asking white people to look at the impact of racism and how they perpetuate and benefit from systems that codify white racial bias.

It is what leads to a black boy being killed for looking \"suspicious\" while walking in his neighborhood. It is what leads to a black patron of Starbucks being removed from the store in handcuffs for failure to purchase prior to asking for a restroom code. Talk about racism. Root it out. Stop finding comfort in the human rationalizations of racism. See the evil for what it is and work to end it.",

Such hate, such deformity of the human soul. <br/><br/>But reading through the article, and the comments, my thoughts came together in the same direction as Michael's. Our categories and metaphors are so crude. \"White America\" and \"Black America.\" \"Dismantling,\" \"privilege,\" \"supremacy,\" \"whiteness.\" These are blunt weapons. They tend to group together all sorts of dissimilar things with dissimilar causes and dissimilar effects. They create resistance, sure, because some people resist acknowledging racism, but they also create misunderstanding and confusion.<br/><br/>I must admit that I'm not sure even our sharp critical tools or our best language are effective against what Yancy was forced to experience. The real change will and must come from person to person, working relationships, friendships, marriages, forms of belonging together and living together that build trust and dissolve fear. That process may have no end since the tribal instinct is deeper than our intellectual or even ethical preferences. Deeper still, as Mr. Yancy knows, is love--and we believers should never give up on that, although it is often a sacrificial road.  ",

As a mainly Scots-Irish American here in Western PA, 'Trump Country' at the moment, I run into it all the time. I make it my business to tell the truth about white supremacy in my political organizing as well as daily life. I try to explain how it holds all of us around here down, though some more so than others. The white-skin privilege is not in the class interest of any worker of any color, any more than the worm on the hook is in the interest of the fish.<br/><br/>When that message starts cracks in the current hegemony, the first glue to come to the rescue is 'white innocence' , \"Yeah, all that is true, but neither I nor my family had anything to do with it. We have worked hard and suffered ourselves (true), so there's nothing about this privilege that applies to us. Blacks should just learn it's time to move on.\"<br/><br/>At this point I have a different task. I have to draw out from them what it means to be a public citizen (the kind that really counts) and to ask them what it means to be part of the human race, the on'y race that exists in their DNA. The mass delusion, you see, is all these folks thinking they're 'white', and we have to do some deconstruction work. ",

There were many black women riding that bus, on the way to daily domestic jobs in the homes of the rich. I chatted with those women and regarded them as my friends. One rare morning, there were some empty seats near the front of the bus. I sat down and invited my friend to sit down next to me. She told me she was not allowed to sit in the front of the bus but could only sit in the back. (I don't know if that was real or just her belief.) I told her that if she could not sit in the front then I would not sit there either. So we walked together to the back and sat down there together. That's the way I was raised and I'm nominally white (Eastern European Jew - 1st generation American.) I do hope Professor Yancy doesn't give up on me or the people who are like me; even in the minority as we are.",

Unfortunately, most of the replies here are full of simple answers that would have already solved the problem a century ago if they were effective...but I do have one thought to add here.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, liberal white people have failed to do the one thing we must do if we sincerely want to begin the process of power sharing: we need to form our own collective identity.  Now I know many whites are deeply afraid of such a process - after all, white \"identity\" has been usurped by the alt-right.  Liberal whites have so far not begun the process of forging an alternative to \"white nationalist\" identity, and this lack of collective identity has put the entire liberal order in jeopardy (note the rise of the right around the world). <br/><br/>As long as liberal whites resist forming their own collective identity, we will reinforce institutionalized racism in two ways: First, we will continue to think of ourselves as \"normal.\" This sense of \"normalcy\" creates a situation in which everyone else must assimilate to us (as usual).  And second, if liberal whites continue on the way we are without the clarity and established values of a collective identity, then we will never think of ourselves as \"one among many\" in a pluralistic society as every other identity must do in this country.  <br/><br/>America's playing field is composed of many groups, many identities, and it's time for white liberals to join the field.

I don’t talk about racism much with White people now because the mere mention immediately becomes personal and defensive as though I’ve attacked their feelings. So it becomes about their defenses and not the issue. <br/><br/>Racist acts are often bold and obvious. Racist beliefs or ideas are often hidden and subtle. It is firmly rooted in our nation’s history. When we all learn all the facts we will have a much more healthy discussion and more honest engagement in solving the problem.

White America, hiding behind their institutions, especially religious, have not only stifled the hopes of people of color, but perpetuated the cycle of poverty and its ill effects. White Americans will then use these failures as weapons to criticize and justify their bias. The argument that ‘they don’t help themselves’ is weak when compared to the data. As a white male American it is clear to me that the deck has been  heavily stacked against serious  progress towards racial equality. And now, with our current president, we are regressing.<br/> However, I am still hopeful because there are many of us who will call out the racial hatred when we see it. Perhaps the backlash from Trump’s ignorance will inspire the next generation of privileged white Americans to be more capable of looking clearly in the mirror and seeing the truth so that we can acknowledge the mistakes of our parents and grandparents.<br/>  Don’t give up the fight Sir, there is still hope.

It was only achievable after decades of sustained, focused effort not only from black people, but from many other people of color, and from white allies who were able to leverage their privilege and persuade southern senators in the 60s to provide the votes needed to pass the bills.<br/><br/>I understand that it's \"not up to POC to tell white people how to fix this.\" But if the question is \"Should I give up on white people?\" my answer is \"no, not until at least considering that part of the reason you don't hear from people who care is the simple fact that they are terrified of inadvertently doing something harmful attempting to help. They are never going to be the ones who solve the problem; many don't know there is one, and if they remain frozen in their uncertainty, it directly harms you.

(I see how the legacy of slavery and segregation has played a central role in producing the social ills that afflict the black community today, but I don't think that's what you're talking about.) Moreover, when the people complaining about those ongoing effects of racism shamelessly lie about the details of supposed instances thereof (e.g., the Michael Brown shooting), I stop listening -- because there's only so much time in the day, and I'm not going to burn much of mine trying to figure out whether people who are consistently dishonest actually have a point.

And why do they shoot suspects 20 or more times instead of perhaps one time in the arm (dont they get training in marksmanship?) <br/><br/>In so many cases the police verbal instructions came after the shooting.  It takes more that 3 seconds to understand and reply to a command.<br/><br/>And tell me why the police after killing someone keep on trying to put handcuffs on the body?<br/><br/>I'm wasting my time, I dont think anything could make you change your opinion.  They were obviously drilled in you in your childhood. <br/><br/>Didn't you even feel any sort of doubt when that white Australian woman who had called the cops because there was a woman being abused in the street, was shot at the window of the police car within seconds before she could even begin to explain why she had called the police?  Since you're already on line, go and check out what the Australian papers have to say about it.....",
